            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>This Vice is offenſiue more to equals, then to Superiors, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, becauſe they be ſeldome, the one ſort or the other, compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors

            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:6321:6"/>
            <p> Pretending to ſufficiencie, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the want of it. The claime it ſelfe is a plaine conuiction that there wants right to the thing clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For where Vertue is really, her owne light diſcouers the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Vino vendibili ſuſpenſa hedera non eſt opus. Good Wine needs no Buſh.</hi> So that hee need not bee his owne Trumpet that is truely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, but rather hee that is not, but onely in his owne conceit: which opinion makes him alſo by not purſuing that which hee ſuppoſes he hath already obtained, to bee out of all poſſibilitie of gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame.</p>
            <p>Honour found out <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> digging in his Garden and made him <hi>Dictator.</hi> And many that in their owne diſpoſitions deſired to liue obſcurely, haue been againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6321:7"/> their wils expoſed to the toyle of great affaires, by the luſtre of that vertue which they neuer boaſted. If to admire any thing argue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of knowledge, much more to admire a mans ſelfe, which al men ought beſt to know, and are moſt familiar withall.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Arrogant</hi> perſon, if hee ioyne in the performance of any laudable action, with men of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt natures, deales with them in the ſharing of the praiſe, as the <hi>Lyon</hi> in the Fable did with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſts, diuiding the prey they had taken; who making of the whole, foure parts, pleades a title to three of them at leaſt, and if they yeelded him not the fourth of their owne goodwill, he would bee no longer friends. And ſuch a nature can hardly hold friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6321:7"/> that admitteth not the Piller thereof, which is <hi>Parity,</hi> but thinks himſelfe ſuperiour to all, if not in Fortune (at which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grudges, taunts her with her blindneſſe, and rayles at her with <hi>Apothegmes,)</hi> yet in all other worth and deſert.</p>
            <p>Hee is ſo puft vp, that to men in eſtate beneath him (for feare of contempt, which howſoeuer he cannot auoid) hee will neuer ſpeake familiarly, ſeldome any way, as if there could be no greater diſparagement, then not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the diſtance which he holds to bee betwixt them. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaneſt ſort vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, cauſeth him to want not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reſpect hee looketh for, as due, but euen that (if any bee ſo) that is due indeed.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:6321:8"/>
            <p> Hee commonly commiſerates his equalls for their weakeneſſes, and loues to teach, rather then learne the thing hee knowes not. Giue him but ſuch a handle, and hee will bee ſure to hold it till one be weary, and will inſtruct with ſuch confidence, that though he produce no reaſon, a man muſt beleeue him on his word, or hee'le be angry. If hee write or ſpeake a diſcourſe of any length, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbeare but hee muſt make knowne ſomewhat of his owne cuſtome, or humor, or life, With <hi>I was this, or did this, or like this, or thus am, or was wont:</hi> belike, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that all men would be glad to make him the patterne of their life and actions.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6321:8"/> his owne eſtimate, he muſt needs hold himſelfe vnder-valued, euen by thoſe that prize him aboue his iuſt worth, then which nothing more vexes him. For though when himſelfe detracts, he thinkes the detracted ought to beare it, as a righteous cenſure: yet if another be but ſleepy in his diſcourſe, or when hee talkes, be taken from him with any buſineſſe, hee is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently grieued thereat, as a high neglect.</p>
            <p>If hee reade anothers writings, hee findes ſomewhat to correct, but nothing to prayſe, and ſo in their actions. Himſelfe being in his owne Iudgement beyond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6321:9"/> his enemy, more then another can do him in his owne.

            <p>But it is beſt when hee encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a cunning Flatterer, for ſuch a one will ſpurre him on, and blow his folly vp to madneſſe, and ſet him out to the laughter of them hee moſt contemned. Or as the Foxe ſerued the Crow, make him to let fall the meate from his mouth with attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſing. Or put him forward to ſeeke an emploiment, which hee, not knowing his owne ſtrength, will bee alwayes ready to take
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6321:9"/> vpon him, and ſo ruine him. For ſuch a one will not feare to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe, what hee does not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. All which be the fitteſt traps for this Vice.</p>
            <p>Some are <hi>Arrogant</hi> (as one may ſay) indirectly, and will extoll ſuch a man in ſuch a faculty, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers allow him to be better in, then the party ſo by him praiſed. But it comes all to one purpoſe; for the face of <hi>Arrogance,</hi> howſoeuer pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not without deformitie. Yet I would not wiſh a man to bee ſo much affrighted with it, as to ſtart to the contrary vice <hi>Puſillanimitie.</hi> For a man ſhould not derogate from himſelfe, there beeing too many, ready enough for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, at leaſt to beleeue him, as one that beſt knowes, what hee moſt wants. And certainely hee

So that theſe diſpoſitions ſhould bee auoyded: if diſcouered, ſequeſtred from imployment, as pernicious and incendiary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambition</hi> was the firſt temptation by which the Diuell wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our firſt Parents, to encite them to a deſire of knowing good and euill equally with God.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange inſinuating affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for whoſoeuer is once there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with poſſeſſed, neither <hi>Reaſon,</hi> nor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6321:12"/> 
               <hi>Impediment,</hi> nor <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> can ſtay his extrauagant deſires. For though <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> enioyed all greatneſſe poſſibly incident to man, yet his <hi>Ambition</hi> ſtopt not, he would be worſhipped as God. It was not <hi>Vertue</hi> nor <hi>Reaſon</hi> that counſelled <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to enterpriſe their domeſtique warres, but a diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate loue of flattering <hi>Ambition;</hi> being in their owne opinions not great enough, which cauſed the ruine both of themſelues &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And as this was theirs, ſo it is the generall and principall motiue to all ſeditious, and trecherous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. But theſe men whilſt they toſſe all, bee themſelues moſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and inwardly feele the torture of this pernicious fury, wherewith they haue offended others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6321:12"/> it is <hi>Apocrypha</hi> to thinke that any man can become truely happy by the way of an other mans miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, if for his owne particular hee be the contriuer.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ambition</hi> ſeazeth vpon a man, peraduenture his firſt ayme will be but vpon deſignes within his reach, or fit for his capacity, which if obtained, is the way to conduct him to higher cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo by degrees, from ſtep to ſtep, the more <hi>Ambition</hi> is fed, the more appetite it hath.</p>
            <p>It is in a kinde the Ape or imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Charity,</hi> ſaith a <hi>Father;</hi> for <hi>Charity</hi> endures all things for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Ambition</hi> for <hi>Tranſitory</hi> happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. That is liberall to the poore, this to the rich. The one ſuffers for <hi>Verity,</hi> the other for <hi>Vanity.</hi> So they both beleeue all things, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6321:13"/> hope for all things, but in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinde.</p>
            <p>I cannot more fitly reſemble an <hi>Ambitious</hi> man, then to one that ſhould haue a fancy, to take a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Eaſt-ward, to the place where the Sun ſeems in riſing to touch &amp; to be ioyned to the earth, in hope to arriue within the reach of the ſame, alwayes going forward, but not comming neerer to his deſire; ſtill progreſſiue, neuer at an end, being impoſſible to finiſh it, but the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he goes, the more earneſt he is and impatient of protraction, and delayes. So that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch natures to be puniſhed with <hi>Tantalus</hi> torture, of whom it is ſaid, that that he deſired, euer ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee neere him, yet neuer within his command.</p>
            <p>Some haue ſimilized theſe kind
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6321:13"/> of men with the <hi>Camelion.</hi> As that hath nothing in the body beſides the lungs: ſo the badge of <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is only windy, and boyſterous oſtentation.</p>
            <p>It is a dangerous thing for men to loue too much, or thinke too well of themſelues. The ſelfe-louer is the Arch-flatterer. Wiſdome and caution may auoid the inſinuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of other men, but when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to admire and applaud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, there is no defence. Therefore this partiall eſtimation, or falſe glaſſe of a mans owne worth and merit, is the true cauſe of <hi>Ambition.</hi> In, or by this wee looke vpon our ſelues with our owne eyes, which are ſo quick-ſighted in diſcerning and reading the infirmities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they turne dimme when they reflect vpon our ſelues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6321:14"/> to the <hi>Scripture. A moate is eaſily ſpyed in the eye of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but a beame in our owne is hardly viſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to this Idolizing of a mans ſelfe, I cannot ſeuer it from the company of <hi>Enuy.</hi> For as the nature of <hi>Ambition</hi> is to commiſerate our ſelues, for that wee ſeemingly want or deſire: ſo when wee ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man poſſeſſed of that, that our endeuours aſpired vnto, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Enuy</hi> breaks forth, priuately ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligning, publikely detracting what we can, both from his perſon, and actions.</p>
            <p>Againe, if a <hi>Vacancie</hi> ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen of that place, wherevpon our whole courſe hath beene bent, then if another ſtep betwixt vs, and home, <hi>Ambition</hi> changes into a malicious, and violent hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6321:14"/> him that poſſeſſeth againſt his friends that oppoſed vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the giuer, that conferred, or beſtowed it. And then vpon this we grow auerſe, and ſullen in all our actions, and venter vpon any miſchiefe of the higheſt degree, or largeſt extent.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, it is impoſſible for an Ambitious man to iudge, and eſtimate the parts, and qualities of another, in reſpect of his owne: for his opinionated ſufficiency makes him vndervalue, and his malice, to vndermine euery man beſides, and either to find, or out of his malignity to faine whatſoeuer is done contrary, or vnknowing to him, to be deficient.</p>
            <p>But if it happen (as it doth rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that their owne conſciences conuince them of another mans
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6321:15"/> deſert and merit, preſently they ſuſpect oppoſition in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that their eminency may be eclipſed. Wherefore they ſtriue and ſtraine by all poſſible inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to put diſgraces vpon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and parts, thereby to hinder his riſing. For whilſt he is out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, finding that he cannot ſo publikely expreſſe his worth, they ſtill labour to keep him in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, to the end that themſelues may ſeeme and appeare more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>But if this emulation happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and one of as publike note, or equall eſtimation with themſelues, then in all ioynt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conſultations, they will endeuour to take from him, and adde as much to themſelues in the opinion of the world, as either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6321:15"/> or Art can deuiſe. Which kind of contention is pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all well-ordred Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. For when euery one ſeeks to be principall, or to engroſſe all within his owne Circumference, and to compaſſe the reſt with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, or affects to make himſelfe the encreaſing figure, whilſt the reſt ſerue but for ſupplyes, faction in buſineſſe, confuſion in directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do neceſſarily follow.</p>
            <p>And what be theſe men that ſo extremely affect Superiority, and Primacy in all affaires? Do they good to the Publike, or is their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice equiualent to their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Do they ſhew by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that this was the principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue that cauſed them to deſire greatneſſe? No. For an <hi>Ambitious</hi> man, ſo ſoone as he is aduanced, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6321:16"/> no more the <hi>duty,</hi> but the <hi>precedency</hi> of his place.</p>
            <p>Some of this ſort that thinke themſelues moſt cunning in their trade, will not plainly profeſſe <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> but maske, or ſhadow it with other colours, whereby they hope they may more ſafely paſſe, vndeſcried, vndiſcouered. They will propound their owne merit and ability, or defect in others, and proteſt they haue no particular ends, but publike reformation; for which only cauſe, they are content to deuote, and enthrall themſelues; when the truth is, the ſpurre that pricks them forward to theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, is glory, and command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others.</p>
            <p>Therfore there is no way to keepe this deſire concealed, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to extinguiſh it.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:6321:16"/>
            <p> If we doe but view theſe men that haue their deſires, and enioy their wiſhes, certainly we ſhould not think it ſo glorious, and happy a thing, as it is giuen out for. Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and trouble continually attend it. And beſides they bee not much more burthenſome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then grieuous to themſelues. Long to continue at the height, is ſeldome ſeene. Extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours be vncertaine, and ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Retire they cannot without ſtaggering, nor deſcend, if not precipitately. Light burdens bee eaſily taken on, or caſt off, without feeling; but if wee bee ouer-loaden, wee ſeldome faile but fall or ſinke. And no man proceeds ſo happily, but ſometimes hee is croſt, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and wayes of this life be ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6321:17"/> mixt and confuſed. Therefore <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious</hi> men had need prefixe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine limit to their increaſe, and not to attend the retyring of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>To affect ſuperiority aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when a mans deſire is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant ouer his reaſon, argues diſtemper and weakeneſſe.</p>
            <p>Some great men that haue, or haue had great Offices, complaine of the paines and vexation they ſuffer, or haue ſuffered, with the weight &amp; burthen of their charge, being worn in yeeres, and decayed both in ſpirit and ſtrength. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to this they would, or could haue beene content to withdraw, or retire themſelues, in reſpect of weakneſſe and debility, from Publique affayres, it would haue expreſſed an excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6321:17"/> and moderation. But few ſuch voluntaries bee found. The traines of <hi>Ambition, Profit,</hi> and <hi>Pompe,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, and whileſt they ſay they hate the trouble, they ſhew by continuing, that they adore the glory, and gaine that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it.</p>
            <p>But leſt we may confound <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,</hi> with worthy deſires, take theſe few differences, or diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the deſire of glory in it ſelfe is not ill, but it is the exceſſe, or defect that makes it ſo. The meane betweene both cannot be expreſt in one word, yet is commendable and allowed for a Vertue. So ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle, Laudatur habitus qui mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum adhibet in expectanda gloria, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amſi uacet nomine.</hi> Shewing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of glory to be matter both of Vertue, and Vice, according as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6321:18"/> it is gouerned, as well as any other paſſion of the minde.</p>
            <p>The vndergoing, or vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Publique buſineſſe, ſo it be more for the generall good, then a mans priuate reſpect, is euer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Common-wealth; but to affect it too much in any kind whatſoeuer, is alwayes taken in the worſt ſenſe.</p>
            <p>For men of place, or Fauorites to bee zealous in the ſtreame, or generall courſe of buſineſſe, is commendable, but to be violent, or ſingular, in the particulars, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferably dangerous.</p>
            <p>To deſire precedency aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in reſpect of ones ſeruice, or merit, is a good emulation. <hi>Nam honos alit artes, omneſ<expan>

            <p>I eſteeme it a great vexation to ſee one affect a grauity in behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as hee will looke vpon you with the ſtayedneſſe of a <hi>Statue,</hi> and obſerue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It appeares moſt in ſome that returne from Trauelling, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vncapable of other proficiency by their obſeruations of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nations, ſituation of Countreys, diſpoſitions of People, their Policy, and the like, theſe things not vnderſtanding, or not knowing how to apply, which to the bettering of our iudgement, and manners, is the right vſe of all we finde either in reading, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, they in their ſtead bring home onely faſhions of behauiour, and ſuch outward apparances, that a man muſt gueſſe they haue trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (for there is no other way) by a <hi>Legge,</hi> or a <hi>Peccadill,</hi> or a <hi>Pieade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,</hi> or a new block, or a mangled ſute, or words all complement, and

            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:6321:22"/>
            <p> All which faſhions, obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; wonders, be collected with being a few moneths in <hi>France.</hi> And thence being wafted ouer, the firſt man they meet, is ſure to know (if this halfe yeere in <hi>France</hi> hath not made them to forget their Engliſh tongue) the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſneſſe of their paſſage, how neere ſhipwracke they were, and talke as learnedly and ſeriouſly of <hi>Nauigation,</hi> onely by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they haue gotten in this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſage in a little Barke, to and fro, as the beſt Captaine can doe that hath been three times in the Eaſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>But all theſe things before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, and diuers more of the ſame kinde, are not onely their firſt month, or halfe yeeres imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſcourſe vpon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6321:23"/> but continue to their dying day.</p>
            <p>At <hi>London</hi> being arriued, they are ſure to make their firſt apparance with their laſt ſute vpon the Stage, there practice, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement and courteſies vpon all their acquaintance, make three or foure forced faces, thence vpon their <hi>Curtoe,</hi> with a Page and two Lacqueys all in a Liuery, goe to the Tauerne, finde fault with all the Wine, and yet be drunke: in which diſguiſe they poſt to their Siſters, or Aunts, or Grandmother, where they will bee admired for their abſurdities, and almoſt made madder then they are by their praiſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe be affected <hi>Monſieurs:</hi> but they that paſſe the Mountaines, and leaue all this leuitie behinde
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6321:23"/> them, what doe they obſerue? How doe they returne? (I meane ſtill affected Trauellers) Of the two the worſe, and the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, becauſe the more graue. <hi>For a light foole is alwayes more ſufferable then a ſerious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The forced grauity of theſe, ſo ſet them forth, as any man may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them with halfe an eye, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hauing the dependances of an Italian Sute, Spaniſh Hat, Milan Sword, N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This for their outſide: but their diſcourſe makes them eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ridiculous. The name of an Engliſh Gelding frights them, and thence they take occaſion to fall into the commendation of a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6321:24"/> Mule or an Aſſe. <hi>A Paſty of Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> makes them ſweat, and then ſweare, that the onely delicacies be <hi>Muſhrums,</hi> or <hi>Caueare,</hi> or <hi>Snayles.</hi> A toaſt in Beere or Ale driues them into Madneſſe, and ſo to declaime againſt the abſurd, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant cuſtomes of their owne Countrey, and therevpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe into the commendation of drinking their Wine refreſhed with Ice, or Snow. So that thoſe things which in other Countries be vſed for neceſſity, they in their own will continue, to ſhew their ſingularity.</p>
            <p>It were not hard in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to point out the men, and it were a good deed to giue you their names, that they may bee publiquely knowne, leſt ſome ignorant of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6321:24"/> bee by their outſide miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledde to admire them. But this may ſuffice, by which you may ſee, that the leuity of the <hi>French,</hi> and grauitie of the <hi>Tranſalpine</hi> Traueller, bee equally ill in the way of imitation; for nothing can ſhew well that is forced. Beſides that, they imitate but imperfectly, and with leſſe grace, like the Stars, that ſhew vs the Sunnes light, but with leſſe ſplendor.</p>
            <p>And they ſo extremely loue to be thought well dyed into <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as their eyes are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at whatſoeuer hath any colour of Engliſh. And to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med familiarly acquainted with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, will ſeeme, and thinke it an honor to haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both the faſhions, &amp; language of their owne.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:6321:25"/>
            <p> But one ſort of affectate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers yet remaine, and they be the ſeeming <hi>Stateſmen</hi> of the time, empty bladders repleate with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but winde, ſuch as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, though it be but in ſome butter Town of Holland, wil make their firſt enquiry after ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to reade Theorie of Statiſme; fellowes that ſwarm in moſt places abroad, eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> or thoſe places where the <hi>Dutch</hi> moſt vſually frequent, that nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſie and apt to be gulled by theſe Impoſtors; beggerly Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that will no ſooner vndertake to teach, but theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly belieue to learne. In the ſpace of ſixe moneths (for that is the longeſt time ſtrangers vſe abroad to ſtay in one place) they will make them able, and when the time is paſt,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6321:25"/> they will ſo beleeue themſelues to be, or peraduenture ſooner (they are ſo fruitfull in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits) that they may declare their abilities to be fit for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt Prince, State, or affaire in the world.</p>
            <p>And this wonder by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of State, is thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly wrought by reading vnto them, with ſome moſt pittifull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations of their owne, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers repetitions of the ſame things, as they vſe to deale with Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, a piece of <hi>Gallo-Belgicus.</hi> Some diſcourſe in <hi>Teſoro politico,</hi> a part of <hi>Sleyden</hi> with <hi>Pezelius</hi> notes, or the like, as, if by reading onely, a man could apt himſelfe for publike employment ſuch a Maſter, ſuch a Reader, ſuch fragments, ſo ſhort a time would enable him therevnto.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:6321:26"/>
            <p> Following this in all places where they come, the very name of a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> rauiſheth them, though it bee but copied out of ſome abſurd booke, printed the laſt Mart; which once knowne, as it will be, by their often enquiry for <hi>things</hi> of that kinde, (any thing, it's no matter what, neither doe they know more then in generall the name of a <hi>Manuſcript)</hi> few mornings paſſe, that ſome poore Scribe or other doth not coozen them in that kinde.</p>
            <p>Meeting with any of their owne Nation, they will endeuour to make them beleeue that they are as well acquainted with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, proiects, and policies of that State or Court where they liue, as any that be there, though of the higheſt employment. They will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6321:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> tell what wayes they haue found out in Cyphring, and what charge they haue been at for Intelligence, which is demonſtrated by hauing ſome papers wauing in their hands, though emptie, or at leaſt but filled with their Hoſts laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>They will proteſt their entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inwardneſſe with the men of the greateſt name and employment in thoſe parts, though peraduenture they neuer ſaw their faces, nor neuer heard them ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, but by a <hi>Mountebanke</hi> in the <hi>Piazza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the great Ones, in their owne Country, what is it not they will ſay, to make vs beleeue they are with them the onely great and entire men of the world? Which familiaritie betwixt them they will
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6321:27"/> endeuour to expreſſe by ſhewing their names to letters, though counterfaite, and Coppies of letters they pretend they haue writ to them, though neuer ſent.</p>
            <p>They will further tell you, that they are abſent thus long abroad, (the State at home ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowledge of their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) becauſe they would yet reſerue ſome libertie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and not bee wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp (as they be ſure, if they were returned they ſhould bee) with publike employment.</p>
            <p>And then they will returne to generalls, and ſpeake of Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>Treaties,</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> where they will ſtop with a ſhrug, or a <hi>Deſunt nonnulla,</hi> and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you to the Starres for a conſequence: as if theſe things
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6321:27"/> were too ſecret, too deepe for your knowledge, or to make you beleeue that the multiplicity of affaires and State-buſineſſe diſtract and trouble their minds; when God knowes, the moſt that they thinke or ruminate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to get the eſtimation and opinion in the world, of that which they haue no colour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, viz. <hi>Witte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, being abroad, they will tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate the very <hi>Gazzette,</hi> the moſt ordinarie and vncertaine newes in the World, to ſend ouer by whole bundles into England, which ſome particular friends of theirs, that know no more of forraigne buſines, then their letters infuſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, by this means are made to beleeue that the ſenders are ſerious, intelligent, and graue, and ſo they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6321:28"/> looke too, when they come home; but thats all. And better vſe I know not which way to put them to, then as a ſigne for thoſe things they outwardly, yet vnhandſomly imitate.</p>
            <p>That little which they ſpeake, or thinke, or doe, ſmels of State. For to get but the name of an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abroad, they will engage themſelues, their friends, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. That is the vttermoſt of their Ambition.</p>
            <p>But that ſmall reputation which report gaue them heere, their owne preſence at their returne, doth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly make to vaniſh. And by this meanes, which no other way could euer bring to their knowledge, they finde the fruit of their oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and thoſe vaine imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which before poſſeſſed them.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6321:28"/> And thus much briefly of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Statiſt. Now to other ſorts.</p>
            <p>It's <hi>Affectation</hi> in one, though naturally an elegant Speaker, not to deſcend a little to the capacitie of ſuch as he conferres withall. For to ſome Country Husbandmen, one were as good ſpeake Latine, as good Engliſh.</p>
            <p>To vſe, in diſcourſing of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſubiect, words of a high, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and Tragicke ſtraine, is as vnſeemelie, as walking on ſtilts, where one may as well goe in ſlippers.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe Ruſticitie in ſpeech, and baſe popular phraſes, in themſelues ſhew want of education, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, diſcouer folly to boote.</p>
            <p>Old Antique words, ſuch as haue beene dead, buried, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6321:29"/> rotten in the time of our Great Grand-fathers, would become the ghoſt of <hi>Chaucer</hi> on a Stage, but not a man of the preſent time.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, New words, like a new Coyne, will not eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, till both their weight, and ſtampe haue beene examined. To which may be referred the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Pomponius Marcellus,</hi> who finding fault with ſome thing that was ſaid in an Oration of <hi>Tyberius Caeſars, Atteius Capito</hi> contrarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that if it were not now La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, yet it would bee heereafter. That is not ſo (ſaith <hi>Marcellus)</hi> for though <hi>Caeſar</hi> can giue naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to men, yet he cannot doe ſo to words. For they can neuer be admitted, till Cuſtome haue allowed them.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6321:29"/> That muſt bee referred to publike vſance, not to <hi>Caeſars</hi> power.</p>
            <p>There bee others that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in figures, and their words fall in, one after another like ſequents; which they bring in, in ſpight both of perſpicuitie, and ſence. And commonly, where a ſpeech is all figures, you ſhall finde the matter a meere Cypher.</p>
            <p>Like to theſe, are ſuch as out of a poore Ambition to obtaine the grace of ſome good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent word, or Metaphore, will not ſticke (ſo they may get it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their writing) to write that which before they neuer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor is perhaps to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or to alter the whole frame of their diſcourſe. And for the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6321:30"/> moſt part ſuch words, as they are ſought with much paine, ſo they are placed at little eaſe, and trouble either the matter, or the method, or the ſtile, for want of elbow roome.</p>
            <p>The worſt <hi>Affectation</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to affect horrible oathes in ſpeech, which ſome doe, thinking them orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or ſignes of a great ſpirit, as indeede they are ſignes of ſuch a ſpirit as they would be frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee appeare.</p>
            <p>Or telling of wonders and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, whereby expecting to beget admiration, they carry away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of liers.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there is a ſort of people, that as in all things they loue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, ſo in this, that they will ſubſcribe to no word that ſauours not of the <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> accounting naturall and good Speech, as <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:6321:30"/> and vnſanctified: But this were better called Hypocriſie then <hi>Affectation.</hi>

            <p>IT is the tongue both of Enuy and Arrogance, which two, though they differ in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet concerning the good name of another, they ſpeak both one language; equally ſtriuing to diminiſh, or takeaway the reward of their <hi>Vertue,</hi> which is <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, and <hi>Charity</hi> be directly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes. The glory of the one is to couer, of the other to diſcouer infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. <hi>Charity</hi> interprets all things to the beſt, the other in the worſt ſenſe: the whole reſpects of the firſt, are to do good to others: but in the <hi>Detractor,</hi> all things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to himſelfe. Many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitudes might be found, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6321:31"/> theſe ſuffice to ſhew how contrary they be; which at the firſt view, ſets but an ill gloſſe vpon <hi>Detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when it is oppoſite to <hi>Charitie.</hi>

            <p>From <hi>Contumelie,</hi> it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſtinguiſhed, then as a thiefe on the way, from him that picks your purſe, or priuily filches your goods in your abſence.

            <p>It hath little force where vertue is eminent. For there Imputation is reuerberated, and made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne on the Author, who depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the fame of a man of knowne deſert, workes no other effect in his hearers, then an opinion of his owne priuate malignity, like a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Sea, beating againſt a firme Rocke, which though it

            <p>The Detractor, to anie laudable atchieuement, will be ſure to finde out wrong cauſes, and to good things, wrong names; as if a man be liberall, hee is prodigall: if par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimonious, couetous: if magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ambitious: if courteous, then hee is of a weake and ſeruile ſpirit: if graue, then proud: if conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in danger, then a Coward: if valorous, raſh: if ſilent, cunning: if a diſcourſer, then one that loues to heare himſelfe talke. When <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> came <hi>neither eating, nor drinking, they ſaid hee had a Deuill:</hi> and when our <hi>Sauiour</hi> came <hi>eating, and drinking, they ſaid, Behold a Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and a wine-bibber.</hi> And ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that there is almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that a man can bee or doe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6321:32"/> which a Detractor wil not peruert.</p>
            <p>Though to praiſe any thing, be againſt his ſtomake, yet hee will magnifie <hi>Fortune</hi> when ſhee hath any hand in an enterpriſe, that <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> (to which he giues the name of the confining <hi>Vice)</hi> may the leſſe appeare.</p>
            <p>They are the very moths, that corrupt and canker in euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; how they worke, and weare, and eate into euery mans good name, experience witneſſeth.

            <p>And wheras men that bereaue vs of our liues, do rarely paſſe without the encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter of ſome or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment; ſhall theſe that depriue vs of that which is ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably dearer, paſſe vnpuniſhed?

            <p>The actions of great men, their liues, their orders, be moſt ſeuerely and ſtrictly viewed. That which they do for the publike, theſe will pretend to bee done for priuate ends. If things according to former conſultation ſucceed wel, they wil take the praiſe wholly from them,

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6321:34"/> fall into, by ſuffering this kinde of people, that I need not in this point further to illuſtrate it.</p>
            <p>In the next place it will not bee amiſſe by way of example, to ſhew that by this meanes, the worſt cauſes doe alwaies ſet themſelues of, in diſgrace of the better, which rule will neuer faile. One inſtance I will giue. The <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> or <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> as they terme themſelues, what doctrine haue they more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, what point more vrged, then for the propagation, as they ſay, of the holy cauſe. Firſt, with the <hi>Phariſe</hi> to magnifie themſelues, and their own opinions, then with termes vnfit to be heard, talke of Eccleſiaſticall functions, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and Gouernment, with that diſdaine and reproch, that they graffe in their followers ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6321:35"/> againſt them, that they thinke all of the contrary opinion, children of Perdition, in the ſtate of Damnation, ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, lewd, profane, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſons. But leauing this path that hath been ſo often bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, let vs view it in other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>Commonly if hee heare any man out of diſcontent, or chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, let ſlip a word to the <hi>derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of another, he preſently takes his aduantage, and his <hi>Exordium</hi> thence, for ſome malicious Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which with that perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the ill opinion already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, ſtrengthens his malice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth his hate, and makes him glory with himſelfe, that hee goes not alone, but hand in hand with other company in his erroneous
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6321:35"/> conceits, and that which priuate reſpects made him formerly to diſlike, that now hee thinkes the others merits might as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke.</p>
            <p>By this artifice the Detractor would bee thought but a ſecond in the point, whereas hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the firſt, or rather onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauer.</p>
            <p>Sometimes hee will profeſſe loue to a perſon, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for truth and ſincerities cauſe, hee will pretend not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to praiſe, and ſo fall into an inquiſition of his life, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, like the fellow in <hi>Horace.</hi>

            <p> Hee deales with a man, as the ſtone in <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> dreame, mentioned in the ſecond of <hi>Daniel,</hi> did with the great Image which it ouerthrew. But thus, it medled not with the gold, nor the ſiluer, nor the braſſe in the Statue; but the lower parts, the legges and feete, which were of iron and clay, thoſe it brake in pieces, and ſo ruined the reſt. In like manner the <hi>Detractor</hi> touches not the Gold, that is, a mans Vertue, which ſhines like it; nor the ſiluer, which is a mans wiſedome, and iudgement, and reſembles it; nor the braſſe, that is, a mans Nobility which gliſters like it; but the iron and clay feete, that is, a mans infirmities, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, errours, thoſe with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane tongue they wound and ſtrike, and by that meanes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6321:36"/> his Honor and Fame in all other parts and qualities, though neuer ſo eminent, in the meane time no body forcing him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe to vtter that truth, to the preiudice of another, that charity would haue concealed.</p>
            <p>Here it will be pertinent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſomething touching the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of cenſuring, with what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is limitted, and how farre to be allowed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Cenſurer,</hi> is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other, obnoxious to Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure, for he thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe into the office of a Iudge, by which eminency he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth mens eyes on himſelfe: and becauſe hee is to be ſuppoſed leſſe faulty then the reprehended, they are therefore alſo inuited to a more ſtrict conſideration of his life, and no leſſe, but rather much more to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6321:37"/> cenſure him, then he another.</p>
            <p>Yet vpon occaſion giuen, or vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when a man is freely to ſpeake his opinion, the concealing, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, or blanching a knowne, or publique errour in any man, confirmes and ſtrengthens him that is vicious, and by this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or at leaſt not blaming, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth others to the like, and withall greatly darkens our owne reputation: for conniuency in this kinde, makes men beleeue, that we our ſelues bee ſubiect to the ſame fault. But this liberty of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring I do thus farre onely allow, that it be amongſt ſuch, as do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly know that mans defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and not others that be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vnto it. For then we ſhould encreaſe rumor, and cauſe an ill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to be had of him.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:6321:37"/>
            <p> Next, the liberty of loue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, will freely allow a man to doe it priuately to his friend; but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let not any foole be his friend, leſt he take the benefit for an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And it muſt be without any bitterneſſe, or ſpleene, which will rather gall, then correct him, that we ſo ſpeake vnto.</p>
            <p>If the particular errours of any one doe, iudicially and pertinently to the cauſe, come in queſtion, there is no doubt but the blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, eſpecially in Publique, bee to be taxed with all manner of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: but the man, in charitie is not to bee triumphed ouer, though this cannot but reflect vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Yet humane frailety which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to vs al, is induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough, ſo long as no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice follow by the example, to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6321:38"/> make the beſt interpretation that ſo ill a cauſe, ſo ill a man, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue. And certainly there is a great deale of caution, and ſparing to be vſed in this kinde of ripping vp a mans life: but if neceſſity bring ſuch a man before you, and that he cannot ſcape a cenſure, yet vſe no opprobrious, or diſdainfull words againſt him.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ſuch as haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued iniuries from a man, and in that reſpect be diſ-affected to him: they will be often glad to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, at his life and conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in heate and choller, by that meanes to bee reuenged of him. But though this be againſt the rule of Charitie, yet in the ſtricteſt ſenſe it cannot come within the bounds of Detraction. For the one is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, the other voluntary; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6321:38"/> habit of doing miſchiefe, without cauſe giuen.</p>
            <p>All truths be not to be ſpoken, (eſpecially if we receiue them but by report) but a man may bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to diſcouer ſuch a truth, as may preiudice another, and yet be free from <hi>Detraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes a man may ſeeke into, or diſcouer anothers infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, either vpon his own, or friends cauſe, and yet not detract, for theſe reſpects. If ſuch a man doe an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it cannot but accidentally fall, in a mans Iuſtification, to ſhew what a kinde of man he is, from whom he hath receiued it. Or ſuppoſe a man haue a cauſe iudicially depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the moſt dangerous thing againſt him be the depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a man, the ciuill Law then allowes, that a man may, to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6321:39"/> weaken or take away his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, bring what he can poſſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that may touch him in life or conuerſation.</p>
            <p>Againe, though a man neede to haue a doore before his lips, and to vſe a great deale of diſcretion and moderation, in whatſoeuer he ſhall ſay, yet if he ſhould chance to fall vpon a man, a little too boldly in the way of cenſuring; certainely if it proceede but from raſhneſſe, and no will, or purpoſe in himſelfe to doe the other hurt, I cannot apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call it <hi>Detraction.</hi> There may bee named other particulars of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet I cannot preſently thinke of any very materiall, that will not bee included within ſome of theſe. But to goe forward to his deſcription.</p>
            <p>Hee inueigheth much againſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6321:39"/> Flattery, &amp; glories that he is free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, making that a cloake to ſhrowd his calumniation. And though it be commendable in euery man elſe to auoyd Flattery, yet it is not ſo in him, becauſe it proceeds from a peruerſe crookedneſſe of nature, that cannot endure anothers praiſe, though iuſt.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe proteſts againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. But if he diſcourſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans actions but his own, you ſhall eaſily obſerue him to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that which makes moſt for his reputation. For, in reckoning vp perſons expert in ſome faculty, to leaue out one of the beſt, and moſt marked in that kinde, or, in commending a mans ſmaller ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to forget his better &amp; greater parts, is a diſſimulation as depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as the bittereſt Inuectiue.</p>

            <p>The ſcope of them is commonly

            <p>WHereas in euery man there bee two faculties of the reaſonable Soule; namely, the Vnderſtanding and the Will: this Vice will admit but one, giuing the whole adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans life into the hands of the latter; which doth ſo much ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize ouer our reaſon, that it makes vs wholly incapable of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, when we heare good counſell: ſo reſolued we be in our owne opinions, though neuer ſo bad, that we leaue no ſpace for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer directions, neuer calling to minde the poſſibility of the rule, that <hi>Standers by, oftentimes ſee more then thoſe that play the game.</hi> And as this ſo opinionated conceit of our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6321:42"/> owne reſolutions, continues the miſt before our vnderſtanding, making vs impatient to receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good counſell: ſo conſequently, it deterres our friends from giuing it, as an vnneceſſary and thankleſſe office, they being out of hope that their endeuours ſhall preuaile, and alſo in feare to hazard the ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe they deſire to continue for friends: as hauing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues altered the receiued definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, who being <hi>Animal ratione praeditum,</hi> ſhould this way be <hi>Animal voluntate praeditum.</hi> Self-willed men being alwayes violent and impatient, if one endeuour to alter or croſſe their reſolutions, which though grounded vpon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſideration, and ſudden raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet they be generally ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and wel-conceited of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6321:43"/> that whatſoeuer they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and purpoſe, muſt be peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, and without alteration. For Selfe-will is nothing but a kinde of will that vſurpes the place and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of reaſon, giuing Antecedence to her actions, before thoſe of the <hi>Vnderſtanding:</hi> as to <hi>Reſolution,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Deliberation; Execution,</hi> before <hi>Counſell;</hi> and the like. For it is not reaſon that guides this wil, becauſe they can giue you none for it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will take this for one, I will, becauſe I will: which is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, womaniſh, and childiſh <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and an argument of ſo ſmal force, that it is a ſhame to vſe it.</p>
            <p>And this is that depriues moſt enterpriſes of good ſucceſſe, but alwaies (howſoeuer be the euent) the enterpriſer of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For good euents depending
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6321:43"/> ordinarily vpon good counſell, they ſeldome chance without it; when they doe, it is by fortune, whence can ariſe no glory to the doer, but muſt wholly be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſome chance. And if any croſſe accident interpoſe it ſelfe, this takes away all excuſe. For as it is ſeemly in no man after a chance, to ſay, I did not thinke; ſo it is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in him, when the cauſe is his refuſing of good counſell, or hearing and neglecting it, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none but his owne. Like a bad Logician, it layes the concluſion downe firſt, and ſeeks the premiſes &amp; inducements after; or as a worſe Iudge, decrees at home, and after heares the parties at the Barre.</p>
            <p>A man ſo conceited of himſelfe, can bee no companion in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratiues, but rather precipitates
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6321:44"/> them, and is altogether of a nature vnfit for buſineſſe, as comming with preiudicate opinions, ſo vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon our reaſon, that we will heare none from any elſe. And therefore if this violence and ſelfe-conceit be ſo dangerous in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, it is farre more in a Iudge. For in the firſt there is equalitie of voyces, and a man cannot ſo eaſily ſway. But in a Iudge, if the will reſolue before, with a kinde of ſettled opinion, notwithſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that can be vrged to the contrary by the Councell at the Barre, I ſee no vſe of pleading, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to draw the Iudges incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and for formality.</p>
            <p>It takes away alſo from a man both his ſight and his guide, and yet haſtens his pace, which muſt needs cauſe precipitation. Whereas
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6321:44"/> receiuing of good counſell, is to one both a light, and a guide, and a ſtaffe, and aſſures him more then the wall, and the watch doth a City.</p>
            <p>A Selfe-will'd perſon moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtops his eares to aduice, as to an enchantment, and when hee is content to heare it (which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) hee doth it either as onely for cuſtome, bringing with him a reſolution what to doe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall be ſaid, and (knowing that ſtrong and euident reaſon hath in it ſelfe a kinde of violence) hee therefore armes himſelfe againſt it with obſtinacy: or elſe admits of counſell, out of a deſire to act his owne deuices, as <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a ſpeech to his Councell with this, That hee called them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to aske their opinions,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6321:45"/> but to haue their confirmation of his.</p>
            <p>Two things make this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſeeme incureable. The firſt is, that it keepes out the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> that ſhould open ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, as being ſtopt, hinder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from the will to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For hee that will admit a friend freely to giue him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and to ſhew him the true cauſes of this vice, might eaſily auoid it. The ſecond is, becauſe the poyſon of flattery is his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary food, and few dare op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the violence of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
            <p>Yet on the contrary, me thinks in time, a Selfe-willed perſon ſhould bee cured, and become very wiſe, becauſe no ſort of men doe more often, or more
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6321:45"/> deepely repent, or buy their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance more dearely, then they doe. Yet ſuch, if they come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, are beholding for it more to their enemies, then friends; for they puniſh them for their follies, and by ſeeking aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, teach them to ſeeke defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their ſafety, and flye to counſell. But as for friends, they be not likely to haue them many, nor wiſe; for who hauing iewels of that price, as wiſedome, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to giue counſell, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to remaine and conuerſe, where hee dare not vtter them, or they bee not at all ſet by? For as there can be no greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to a wiſe man, then to haue his counſell made vſe of; ſo there is no greater ſcorne and vexation, then to haue it neglected.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:6321:46"/>
            <p> This vice proceeds from two cauſes, which are firſt <hi>Arrogance,</hi> and next, <hi>a debility of the mind,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with an earneſt deſire to ſome pleaſure or appearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. The firſt cauſe works vpon ſtiffe and ſeuere natures: the latter, in women, and men of ſoft and effeminated affections. The firſt maketh the vnderſtanding by preiudging, vnfit to diſcerne of good aduice: the latter diſableth the will to follow it. The firſt makes it more dangerous: The ſecond more incurable.</p>
            <p>Yet betwixt <hi>Selfe-will</hi> and <hi>Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> a man muſt diſtinguiſh as much as betwixt a ſetled reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a wiſh, as one many times deſires prohibited things may bee lawfull, though hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues them not to bee ſo, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:6321:46"/> ſo followes not, but bridles his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>
            <p>Beſides, notwithſtanding all this, I hold it better for any man that hath a mediocrity of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be wedded to his owne will, then to the will of any one man beſides, the danger being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall of both ſides; for as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture is great, wholly to depend vpon our own wills, ſo inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is farre worſe, when a man will bevaried and diſpoſed with diuers, or ſingle opinions. It is better to ſubiect our ſelues to our owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites with little reaſon, then to another mans with leſſe. The meane is, neither to reſolue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apparance of reaſon, nor to be altred, vnleſſe with better; neither to bee ſubiect to the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor too peremptory in our

            <head>Of Maſters and Seruants.</head>
            <p>THis part of <hi>Oeconomicall</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is in abſtract, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Gouernment. To be vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in the firſt, argues much diſability for the latter. Hee that cannot rule his owne familie, is much more incapable to gouerne a multitude.</p>
            <p>In this deſcription I accept not Seruants as bound, nor Maſters as abſolute, but take them in thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as with vs they be generally receiued, where there is left to both an equall libertie, and free election. And as a Seruant is bound in obedience to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which is the part hee muſt act; ſo a Maſters power is limited,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:6321:48"/> that hee cannot impoſe vpon him diſhoneſt employments, nor exact a ſtrict performance of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in any action of that ſort. Wherefore, where commands be lawfull, obedience is due, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not.</p>
            <p>In your choyce, firſt, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to bee knowne, next, the man. For to affect extraordinary multitudes, expreſſeth oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If your owne knowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you not with a ſeruant for your vſe, then venter vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers recommendation, but caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly. Firſt, know his integrity, and next, his iudgement; leſt out of his affection he preferre one, for his preferment, and not for your vſe; or that through ignorance he preſume one to be fit, that is a mere
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6321:48"/> ſtranger to ſuch employments as your occaſions require. And to take a man of his own word, is the worſt of all. For many will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for their owne ſufficiency in thoſe very things they vnderſtand not.</p>
            <p>To take a ſeruant, though capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any impreſſion, yet wanting experience, is more fit for a Maſter that hath employment in expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, then preſent, though certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in time, ſuch do proue the beſt Seruants, and follow onely the method of their Maſters directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for they ſeldomeſt varie from his very thoughts, and make ſuch buſineſſes as paſſe their hands, to be euen done by himſelfe. But this way is laborious, and requires both an apprehending Seruant, and an intelligent Maſter.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:6321:49"/>
            <p> In matter of buſineſſe, neuer thinke it to bee ſo well done by troopes, as few and able Seruants; for in diſpatch numbers euer breed confuſion, where affaires bee alike, and equally diſtributed. For your Seruants either truſt too much one to another, or emulate, and ſo it reſts vndone; eſpecially if there be not one Superintendent, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes and directs the reſt. But if you haue buſineſſes of diuers and ſundry natures, then it is good to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into ſuch parts &amp; degrees, as one man may not depend vpon another: for where one is full of employments, he muſt of neceſſity ranke his Seruants according to the diuerſitie of his buſines, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that he be ſure himſelfe often to take a particular account of their ſeuerall diſpatches, which vſing,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6321:49"/> or omitting, prouokes either dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or careleſneſſe in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. More eſpecially in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of employing your ſeruant in matters of account, and expence, you ought often to reuiew, and giue allowance of thoſe things that paſſe vnder his charge. For firſt, you may truſt one whom you thinke honeſt, though he be not, and then you are ſure without great care to be deceiued. Next, if you be negligent in taking his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and not remembring euery particular, you may ſuſpect him that is honeſt, &amp; without a cauſe; ſo that both for your owne ſake, and his, this courſe will be neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>Now in this great truſt, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be as it were of neceſſity tyed to conferre vpon their ſeruants, one whoſe integrity you are moſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6321:50"/> confident of, is the man, that with the generall bulke, and burden of your affayres, I would haue you communicate, eſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe parts require ſecrecy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of your ſelfe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If you ſhould omit this, and referre all to your owne memorie, ſomethings might be forgot, others miſtaken, when you are preſſed both with multitudes, and varietie of buſineſſe. Yet a Maſter need be very preciſe, what, and how much truſt he repoſes in a ſeruant: no man but is ſubiect to ſome faults, which they ought rather to hide, then to reueale. Communicating then of them to our ſeruants, doth not onely decreaſe reſpect, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in them, but alſo ſubiects vs to their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger; if either vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, malice, or trechery, they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6321:50"/> haue at any time a minde to doe vs an iniury; or, if their eaſineſſe, and facilitie make them liberall in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing of truſt, or elſe out of a hope to gaine grace and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they bragge of the confidence repoſed in them, which muſt be expreſſed by ſeeming to know thoſe things of vs, that in reaſon we ought to conceale. And if a man cannot be ſo true to himſelfe, as to keepe thoſe things hee would haue ſecret from the knowledge of his ſeruants, why ſhould hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more ſecrecy in a <hi>Seruant,</hi> then he findes in himſelfe? For as we, out of ſome conceiued good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, lye open to them, it is likely, they alſo may haue ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whom they equally eſteeme, and may be as confident in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing their owne, and your truſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6321:51"/> to them, as you were to your man, and that friend may haue another, and ſo in time, our moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealod actions, become pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
            <p>In particular and ſeuerall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, you muſt apply your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to thoſe that haue the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of that kinde. For ſuch as require conſideration, and debate, I would haue you conſult in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, with all thoſe you haue ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for buſineſſe: &amp; when you haue both diſcuſſed the difficulties, and reſolued on the courſe, then for the expedition, referre it to the particular care of him, whoſe part is to deale with the affayres of that nature.</p>
            <p>In this domination that Maſters haue ouer their Seruants, two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes are to be auoided. <hi>Seueritie,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:6321:51"/> and <hi>Facilitie.</hi> One makes them to feare, the other, to preſume too much. The firſt, brings them too neere the nature of Bondmen; the ſecond, of Fellowes. This breeds hate, that contempt. But obſerue the golden mediocritie, both to command, and not be feared; to be familiar, and not ſcorned.</p>
            <p>Let your conuerſation be ſuch, that your ſeruants may take a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne from your actions, of vertue, &amp; not deformities. The liberty and licentiouſneſſe of Superiours doth not onely prouoke, but nouriſh vices in lower rankes. Men be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enclined to a pleaſing and voluptuous kinde of life: and when they ſee thoſe that be aboue them, to liue looſely without any manner of reſtraint, they thinke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> lawfull to imitate, and be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6321:52"/> to follow the faſhion, as it were by preſident. Beſides, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience happens to Maſters themſelues, that they cannot with iuſtice blame their Seruants, for thoſe faults, whereof themſelues be as guiltie, and for the example more blameable; eſpecially, if they vſe their ſeruants to baſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt employments, which muſt needs turne to their Iuſtification, if euer they fall into any errours of that, or the like kinde.</p>
            <p>Alter your ſeruants rarely, and but vpon extraordinarie occaſions. Doing otherwiſe, argues weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in your firſt choiſe, leuitie in your change, and ſhewes you to be of an ill diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, for thoſe ſeruants that be of chiefeſt employment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, as their buſineſſe and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6321:52"/> truſt is greater then the reſt, ſo ſhould their exhibition be: it doth not onely reward their merit, but makes them more diligent. And yet I would not haue you to be at once ſo liberall-handed, as that they ſhould take that for their laſt reward: but vpon new occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſeuerall merits, expreſſe ſomething of your bounty. And in your preferments, if your place can giue you leaue, they that way may be plentifully recompenced in ſubordinate employments vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, and ſo together both ſerue you, and profit themſelues. If you haue not this way to preferre your Seruants, but that it muſt come out of your owne priuate ſtate, then your buſineſſe being the leſſe, your traine may be the ſhorter. For as it expreſſeth ingratitude, not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6321:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> to reward feruants, So it ſhewes little foreſight, if in indeuoring to raiſe the fortunes of too many you empaire your owne. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, when a ſeruant depends vpon you, as you ought not to defend him in doing of iniuries, ſo you are bound to protect him from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing them. Men of qualitie and place, they may, and muſt haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as well for <hi>Honor,</hi> as <hi>buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse.</hi> In appearing abroad, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments at home, they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, and adde reſpect. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the numbers, I will now deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the deſcription of ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as the wiſeſt Maſters ſhould affect to chooſe, and in what kinde he ought for to vſe them.</p>
            <p>And firſt in their choiſe, I would haue them to auoid all, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer preſent ſtate, or fame, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6321:53"/> had beene noted for, or branded with any notorious crime. It is ſeldome ſeene, that either puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſhame, reduce men to good, but rather confirme them in euill, and diſſolute behauiour.</p>
            <p>Neither would I take a man that preſumed too much on his owne ſufficiencie, or that ſeemed to bee extreme wiſe in his owne conceit. Such a diſpoſition is fond and ridiculous in all ſorts, but in a ſeruant moſt intolerable. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he doth, will ſmell of <hi>Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>Arrogance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men that bee <hi>married,</hi> they bee euer leſſe diligent then others, and therefore he that can keep but few ſeruants, had beſt make choiſe of thoſe that be ſingle.</p>
            <p>Such a one as is alwayes prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to you of preferment, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6321:54"/> of Sures, and putting you in minde of his merit, is a ſeruant meerely for his own ends, and not at all for yours, and is euer accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the ſpirit of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and preſumption.</p>
            <p>Such as affect Principalitie in your employments, and Primacie aboue others, be of buſie, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ambitious, and factious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and therefore vnfit for ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Such as are too officious, and inſtruments of diſſention in a houſe, by doing ill offices, betwixt a Maſter and the reſt of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in flattering of him, cenſuring or ſlandering of them, thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be made of too crooked tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for this building.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that will be prying into your moſt ſecret affayres, cenſuring
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:6321:54"/> your actions, murmuring at your rebukes, be moſt pernicious, and incorrigible.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I would auoid ſuch as haue paſt through the hands of many Maſters: for, as that may be a ſigne of ſome ill qualitie that they haue, ſo it neceſſarily expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to bee of inconſtant and giddy diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>But ſuch as be diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in their duties, faithfull in their ſeruice, truſty in their places, and louing to their Maſters, be the ſeruants of whom you are to make election, reſolution ſhould be to keepe, and will to preferre, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their merits, and your own abilitie.</p>
            <p>A Maſters part is to command, and a Seruants to obey: wiſedome is required in the one, and duty
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6321:55"/> in the other. Maſters ſhould ſo liue with their inferiours, as they would wiſh their Superiours ſhould doe with them; and they know beſt how to gouerne, that know how to ſerue.</p>
            <p>Put not your ſeruants to baſe offices, nor make them not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of your licentiouſneſſe, and luxury.</p>
            <p>Neither tyrannize ouer them with ſtrokes, for that argues intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance: nor rebuke them with publique checkes, and ſcornes, which be both inſufferable, and diſgracefull.</p>
            <p>Suffer your ſeruant ſometimes the freedome of ſpeech, and let not his lips be euer ſealed in your preſence. They that ſpeake leaſt to you before your face, ſeldomeſt ſpeake good of you behinde your
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6321:55"/> backe. Such ſeruants as ſpeake moſt freely before their Maſters, bee moſt reſerued in diſgracing his perſon, or publiſhing his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>Thinke not your ſeruant, your ſlaue. Fortune hath as much power ouer the one, as the other. You haue no certainty of not being transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſame, or a worſe degree. You are borne after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, enioy the ſame ayre, eate the ſame bread, breathe, liue, and dye alike with them. Therefore inſult not too much, and reduce them not to ouer-great ſubiection. For loue can neuer ſuffer mixture with feare. And thinke not that there is ſo great a diſtance betwixt you, and your ſeruant: for there bee few Maſters, that ſerue not either Pride, or Women, or Ambition
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6321:56"/> or Feare, or Couetouſneſſe. And theſe kindes of ſeruitude, which be moſt voluntarie, are alwayes moſt reprochfull.</p>

            <p>EXpences doe naturally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide themſelues into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Honour, Charitie,</hi> and <hi>Neceſsitie:</hi> the firſt requires a Great man: the ſecond, a good man: the third is common to both. Honourable expences bee commendable: Charitable, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: and Neceſſarie, forced. The firſt addes reſpect: the ſecond, loue: and the laſt, ſhewes our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty. Inaptitude to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſhewes a man to be of a poore and ignoble ſpirit: backwardneſſe in the next, expreſſeth an Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and heatheniſh nature: and not promptneſſe to the third, argues a moſt peruerſe, and couetous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But on the contrarie,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6321:57"/> to vndoe a mans ſelfe with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and magnificent charge, is the badge of a <hi>Vaine-glorious</hi> man: to cloath another, and goe naked himſelfe, is a ſigne rather of Fryerly <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> then of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> To limit our whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for our ſelues, and to bee couetous in reſpect of others, and prodigall in our owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is the true marke of a <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, Luxurious</hi> and <hi>Selfe-louing</hi> condition. Let not therefore Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable expence bee ſtayned with waſting: neither let <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall oſtentation</hi> bee ioyned to our <hi>Charitie:</hi> and take heede that <hi>ſuperfluitie</hi> choake not either. And loue not <hi>Riches,</hi> more then your <hi>Reputation,</hi> the <hi>Poore,</hi> or your ſelues: but let your honour be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without <hi>Pride:</hi> the poore

            </p>
            <p>Expences ſhould euer be limited according to the occaſion, and our own ability. For vnneceſſary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be as vaine as the other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. They that ſpend more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue, want gouernment: they that ſpend all, Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And as a man ſhould take an account of his expences paſt: ſo hee ought to make a rate of what he meanes to ſpende. For incertainties of this kinde be neuer good. As expences bee proportioned, ſo the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſhould bee certaine, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a man walkes in the darke. But this is to bee vnderſtood of ſuch as haue a competencie, bee come to yeeres of ripeneſſe and iudgement, and that haue not been by any caſualtie, or accident put
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6321:58"/> behinde hand in the world. All which though they do not auoid the miſchiefe, yet they extenuate the error.</p>
            <p>Riches be ordained for our vſe, but neither to bee <hi>adored,</hi> nor <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</hi> A <hi>Prodigall</hi> runs thorow his eſtate, and is ſo entangled to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, that hee is neuer maſter of himſelfe: this is the fruit of the <hi>Contempt.</hi> A couetous man, as he is farre from benefitting others, ſo he is loath to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but liues in the ſtate rather of a Steward for another, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his owne. And this is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the <hi>Adoration.</hi> So that in this there can be no other medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, or better compoſition, then to ſpend with diſcretion, that that you haue honeſtly obtained. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is a Vertue, and ſo is Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6321:58"/> within their ſeueral bounds, but the error is, when the one ſteps, or the other declines too neere the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thoſe men that bee bleſt with great and fortunate eſtates, I thinke to bee tyed euen by the law of Nature, to a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like appearing, then thoſe that bee below them, either in degree, or eſtate, to a willingneſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the neceſſities of others, proportionably according to their abilities, and ſo to prouide for their poſteritie, that they may rather finde encreaſe then dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of any part of their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>A man ought to moderate his expences, and keepe them within certaine limitations; for he is bound to encreaſe and better
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6321:59"/> the fortune of his Family, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and marrie his children, to be of a reaſonable ability, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, when that which he loues and likes, may chance to be offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to haue meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe from wrongs and iniuries, to keepe him from being contemptible in the world, and many reſpects more in the ſame kinde. But for a man to ſuppoſe too great a neceſſity in theſe or the like occaſions, and make that a colour for extremitie of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I cannot imagine a man ſo rich, that may not that way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an occaſion for as much more, if it were poſſible to be had; ſo that there is no end in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if the more a man enioyes, the more he deſires, though in a mans fortune I thinke it better for ones
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6321:59"/> conſideration, to fixe vppon the competencie, then ſuperfluitie of his eſtate.</p>
            <p>In priuate expences it is good to be neere, in publike, <hi>magnificent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poore and baſe to ſpare in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable expences, to the end they may the better ſpend vpon their priuate pleaſures. Therefore hate <hi>Couetouſneſſe,</hi> but endeuour Thrift, deſpiſe <hi>Prodigality,</hi> yet loue to bee liberall.</p>
            <p>To ſpend vpon backe and belly too ſumptuouſly, too deliciouſly, cannot bee reckoned in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of honourable expences, but mere effects of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme.</hi> And I am perſwaded that indeede there bee none more auaricious then theſe gorgeous ſpenders. Honeſt expences they thinke makes no ſhew, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6321:60"/> they find giues no taſte; wherefore they neglect them, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing couetouſly to lay vp, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may feede their ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and delicacie. And you ſhall commonly ſee in expences of this kinde, more deſire, more zeale then in any ſort beſides, as being gouerned by the ſquare of irregular paſſions, and neither by the rules of <hi>Honour,</hi> nor <hi>Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is not good to haue our liberality wedded to ſome kinds of expences, and in others of as great account to grow miſerable, as to be bountifull to our horſes, and keepe a beggerly houſe, to be ſumptuous at our Miſers feaſt, and then liue like Farmers all the yeere after. Theſe extremities be not good, but according to euery mans meanes, an equality is to be kept. Vſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6321:60"/> yet forget not your profit; you may be liberall, yet hurt not your ſtate.</p>
            <p>I haue knowne ſome, and very rich, who all their life time haue not beene acceſſary to one good and charitable act, and yet, after their death, giue order to diſpoſe of their eſtates more liberally in this kinde then any other, which ſhew of Charitie I eſteeme not: for it is neceſſitie of leauing, and not deſire to doe good, that enforces that act. Or, peraduenture it proceeds from cuſtome: for they who all their life haue neuer benefited any of their friends or kindred, are loth to alter or differ from this habit in their death; and not knowing elſe what to doe with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, be after a manner forced to this poore Charitie, in ſpight of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6321:61"/> their hearts. For if it were poſſible to haue themſelues and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney buried together, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that they would rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to that way.</p>
            <p>It is not the meere doing of good, but the willingneſſe and cheerfull proceeding that crownes acts of this nature. The very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring and protraction argues it to bee an action rather ſtrained then voluntary. And beſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits thus beſtowed, when we are dead, deſerue neither the Attributes of Charitie nor Liberalitie, for that that wee then part withall belongs to another owner, for it neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines to vs, nor is in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>If a man would truely enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a contemplatiue conſideration of riches, certainely he would find
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6321:61"/> them extremely ouer-valued, and in themſelues worth nothing, but that eſtimation makes them ſo; ſo that they haue rather gotten a name and reputation in the world by opinion then merit. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the moſt carefull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uider to foreſee the fortune of his wealth, whether continued, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, diſperſed, or loſt. The firſt ſtocke one may gheſſe of; but to preſume of farther aſſurance, is vaine, and vncertaine.</p>
            <p>Riches be therefore well placed, when a man can as contentedly leaue, as enioy them: which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will eaſily doe, that eſteems them not beyond their vſe, nor is deceiued by their luſtre.</p>

And yet it is a wonder to ſee what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes there bee of all ſorts, that make this their only buſineſſe, and in a manner, ſpend their whole
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6321:62"/> time in complement, as if they were borne to no other end, bred to no other purpoſe, had nothing elſe to doe, then to bee a kinde of liuing walking ghoſts, to haunt and perſecute others with vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary obſeruation.</p>
            <p>It is an argument either of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or deceit, for any to bee more ceremonious then reall, which is neceſſarily implyed in theſe vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary viſits. For they expreſſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Simplicity,</hi> or <hi>Flattery,</hi> the one the weakeſt, the other the baſeſt quality that can bee incident to any. Wiſe men will not view ſuch perſons but with ſcorn, nor reſpect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but with diſeſteem; for men of ability, &amp; iudgement vnder-value, rather then praiſe them, for theſe needleſſe complements, as being the practice of light &amp; fantaſticall,

            <p>Some goe abroad, and God knowes, the <hi>Viſited</hi> be not behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. For if theſe giddy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bee forced to giue a reaſon for their wheeling vp and downe the ſtreets, their anſwere is, <hi>they know not elſe how to paſſe the time.</hi> And how tedious it is, for a man that accounts his houres, to bee ſubiect to theſe vacancies, and apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to loſe a day with ſuch time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſers, who neither come for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, nor out of true friendſhip, but onely to <hi>ſpend the day,</hi> as if one had nothing elſe to doe, but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their idle time: how hard a taske this is, thoſe that be haunted

And if that ſerue not the turn againſt their vntimely viſits, then bolt my doore, or hide my ſelfe, which ſhift I haue known many put to for want of other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>And beſides, when theſe ſpirits walke abroad, it is rather to ſhew themſelues, then to ſee any, which for the moſt part is neuer in the Morning; (and eſpecially on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,</hi> becauſe it is the beſt day in the weeke) all that while they bee building themſelues, and viewing

            <p>There be of this Family, or Sect, that are ſo punctuall, and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in their art, that they turne <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi>

            <head>Of Death.</head>
            <p>NOthing is more certaine then Death, and nothing more vncertaine then the the time. Euery man is to pay this debt, though few bee ready at the day; life is but lent vs, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the obligation is Death, yet not without a penalty, if in this wandring and vncertaine ſtate wee make no preparation.</p>
            <p>Life then being ſo ſhort, Death ſo certaine, a man ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his thoughts within the ſmall circle of the preſent being, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them to more high and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conſiderations; and one is the immortality of the ſoule, which without compariſon is the chiefe and only happineſſe; the next is,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6321:67"/> perpetuating of a good name; which according to the actions of our life good or bad, continue in memory and fame after wee bee dead: and ſurely, a man that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affinity with Vertue or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and is not only borne for, but buried in himſelfe, as he ſhould deſire an honeſt report and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to continue of him, ſo he ſhould feare the contrary. Euery man naturally deſires to haue his name continued by children and poſteritie; and certainely it is a great bleſſing, yet ſurely the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a great mans life, if they be good, make his name, when dead, more durable.</p>
            <p>Beatitude is neuer ſeene in this life, but by a falſe light; wee muſt bee diſſolued, transformed, and changed, before wee arriue to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6321:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> and fruition, which cannot be confer'd in this, but a higher habitation. Many examples, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if common or vſuall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert into precept, yet theſe which bee moſt viſible, leaſt auaile; for though wee daily ſee our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, friends, and children taken from vs, yet wee prouide and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for this life, as if we were irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouable, and thinke of death no otherwiſe, then as a tale that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to fright vs, till the ſtroke come home to our owne dores. So fond, ſo vnſettled be our cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For a man in nothing more ſhewes the goodneſſe, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſpirit, then in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and not fearing Death; for it muſt come, and feare cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent it. And me thinks therefore, the certainty of it ſhould abate ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6321:68"/> therfore relie not ſo much vpon ſo vncertaine and tranſitory an eſtate.</p>
            <p>And the continuall paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of our children, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and friends, by this gate, are but ſo many guides and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners to vs, and the neerer one is either in affection, or alliance, the application ſhould bee more particular to our ſelues. Some thinke to deceiue, or preuent, or delay this blow, and attribute the cauſe of it rather to accident, then prouidence; as if the rules of dyet, or Phyſicke, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to oppoſe fate; though I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not againſt thoſe meanes the which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the preſeruation of life; but I eſteeme them only as helps, and not cauſes of continuance.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6321:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> All men in this life be ſubordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouerned: we are naturally bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and liue not by miracle, but ſuſtentation: ſo that it is as ill to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid thoſe helpes, as to truſt to them.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange, but vulgar error, for men to ſay, counſell or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per would haue preuented ſuch a mans death; might they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſeuerall, ſudden, and ſtrange accidents that leade to this end, that there bee not more men then wayes that conduct to this condition? Children die before Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; ſtrong, before weake; ſound, before ſickly; which as often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by ſmall &amp; vnobſerued chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as great diſeaſes: as a man goes well to bed, and is ſmothered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore morning; is well at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a meale, and dead before
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6321:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> the end; now in a ſerious diſcourſe, and dead, in the midſt of a word. He that's a friend to day, proues a murtherer to morrow; a pillow may ſtifle, ſmoke may ſuffocate, a Fly may choke. This, if it were to be illuſtrated by examples, would plainely ſhew, that there is no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor inſtrument ſo ſmall, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerued, that is not maſter of our life.</p>
            <p>Therefore to eſteeme life aboue the price, or to feare death beyond the rate, be alike euill. No man can bee in loue with this world, that is not in ſome doubt of the next. He that reſpects life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects little beyond death. But then it may be demanded, Are thoſe the beſt men, that be moſt weary of this life, and therefore haſten death with their owne hands?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6321:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> Certainely no. For euery act in that kinde, ſhewes that it was not in reſpect they hated to liue; but becauſe of <hi>want, feare, puniſhment, ignominie,</hi> and diuers other cauſes, that theſe examples do dayly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and are notoriouſly knowne. Man is created by God, therefore not to be his own executioner, but to wait for the time, and expect the houre of his Call.</p>
            <p>A mans Peregrination in this life ſhould be employed, but as a harbinger for Death, nay rather, life: for whilſt we liue, we die; but liue not till death. Yet good men, may in a ſort religiouſly feare death, in reſpect of the cauſe of it. <hi>For the wages of ſinne, is death.</hi> In reſpect of not knowing the place of our being after death (wee our ſelues being altogether vnmeriting)
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6321:70"/> theſe, and the like conſiderations, may iuſtly make death ſeeme terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But to goe on.</p>
            <p>How can a man think himſelfe happy in this world, without the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a better? If a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that his heart can wiſh, if hee know not want, haue plenty in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance: theſe things may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make him glory in himſelfe, and in a kinde of ſcornefull pitie to commiſerate thoſe that be below him; yet the conſideration of Death, and the little while hee hath to enioy theſe temporary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes, turnes all his pleaſures into melancholy, his ſweetneſſe, to gall. This is the happieſt condition, that the happieſt man can haue, that thinkes there is no happineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this life.</p>
            <p>But if you view other men,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6321:71"/> and ſee what cares, what haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, what iealouſies, what ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and what miſeries, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in all kindes, onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and pleaſe themſelues in this ſhort, troubleſome, dangerous, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, and weariſome life, you would think them rather dreames then ſubſtances, fictions, then men.</p>
            <p>But ſo liue, as neither the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world may poſſeſſe, nor the miſeries confound you. Boaſt of nothing in your ſelfe, but that you are a liuely repreſentation or Image of your Creator, which you deforme, if you look to earth, or thoſe things which bee below. The benefits which God hath heere beſtowed vpon you, vſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his direction, but not contrarie to his command; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6321:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> feare not, but welcome death, as beeing the end of your vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and beginning of your ioy.</p>
            <p>Many men without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Religion, haue excellently expreſſed their contempt of Death, but that may bee reduced ſome of theſe cauſes: peraduenture they had a kinde of vncertaine opinion that ſome greater happineſſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, then accompanied this life: or, in reſpect of the dayly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their mortalitie, cuſtome extinguiſhed feare: or laſtly, to perpetuate their memories, or publiſh their fame to ſucceeding ages, haue for the liberation of their Country, or Friends, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, voluntarily expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to a certaine and preſent death.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:6321:72"/>
            <p> There be few lingring diſeaſes, or ſudden paines, that be not more ſenſible and painfull then Death, and the recouerie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, is but as a ſhort reprieue.

            <p>This kinde of life hath beene more familiar with vs, then other Nations; ſo that we haue in a kinde appropriated it to our ſelues; more

Amongſt which his firſt ſhould bee to expreſſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6321:74"/> and Hoſpitality in his houſe, and bountifull liberality towards his poorer neighbours: theſe be the true orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of a Country houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper; an honourable cuſtome, ſo peculiar to our Nation, that that way we haue out-gone all others; and howſoeuer of late it hath been declining and decaying, yet it is worthy of renouation, being ſo great a ſtay to the Country, ſuch a releefe to the poore, ſo honourable for themſelues, and exemplary for poſterity, the very knot which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts ſociety &amp; conuerſation, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for ones friends and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which be the chiefeſt ſolaces of a mans life, and the ſureſt way to make a man be loued of thoſe that know, and eſteemed by all that heare of him. To ſet downe a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rate and order in keeping
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6321:75"/> of ſuch a houſe, is not now my purpoſe: that it ought to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned regularly and religiouſly none doubts; and not replete with thoſe confuſed diſorders, &amp; riots, which ſome licentious &amp; prodigall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions haue allowed. That makes it rather a ſnare and inuitation to nouriſh lewd, and baſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to bee either a ſtay, or releefe to the Country where they liue.</p>
            <p>Next, vnder pretence of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and free life, for a man to take too much vpon him, expreſſing <hi>Arrogancy</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> to thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, in his owne opinion, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in himſelfe that greatneſſe and power, which is not his due; ſquaring his actions by his will, not reaſon; forcing to his ends by the way of greatneſſe and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6321:75"/> not equity and Iuſtice; awing his neighbours with his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and power; turning law into affection, and reaſon to appetite; theſe ſhould be none of the ends in a noble and good nature, when he chooſeth a country life; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, a purpoſe to expreſſe ſuch moderation and modeſty in all his actions, that he may be vſefull, not oppreſſing; ſeruiceable, not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome; loued, not feared in the Country where he liues.</p>
            <p>And hauing heere, and thus ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, his life muſt not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſerued to his owne quiet, and particular pleaſures; but in that place wherevnto he is called, and deſtined to liue, to apply himſelfe, and ſeruice, for the common and publike good; which in ſuch a life as this, will principally conſiſt in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6321:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> theſe particulars. The diſordered and vnruly life of thoſe vnder his authority &amp; command, (ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thoſe outrages of <hi>Murder, Theft,</hi> and the like which the law puniſheth, and impoſeth alſo a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vpon his vigilancy) he ought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, not only to ſuppreſſe, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent all bold &amp; contemptuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of one neighbour towards another, all ſeedes of ſeditions and quarrels, and ſuch common means as in the Country vſually prouoke them. Generally alſo, all manner of diſtemper in the Country ought to be qualified by his iudgement and diſcretion; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the better ſort, if any faction or emulation ariſe, then the vertue of his authority muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in equall moderation. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is chiefly to take heed, that when factions be ſided, his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6321:76"/> vphold not one faction, to the decay and ruine of the other; but contrarily to euen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them in mutuall amity and agreement.</p>
            <p>Againe, in this place, he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preuent il, but to do good, and that, firſt by his example, in equally bearing part of the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſeruices, with the reſt of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, (though in quality below, and in akind depending vpon him) &amp; this not onely in the priuate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his dutie &amp; place, but alſo in the ſollemne and publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, for diſtribution of Iuſtice; which will bee a verie great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and inuitation, to awake others diligence, as alſo an excellent reſtraint of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and fauour, in the ſeuerall votes of the reſt, which oftentimes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6321:77"/> reſpect perſons, more then cauſes, or ſpleen then truth; this good will follow the endeuours of ſo great a man, if he carry himſelfe euenly, and without priuate ends, in the buſineſſes of the Country; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the miſchiefe will bee more dangerous in awing the Country, then the benefit neceſſary in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning it: but if he be of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prepared with integrity; then to declare his ability in Country ſeruices (I doe not ſay alwayes to engroſſe them) will make the reſt more wary in their ſteps, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the vprightneſſe of their endeuours. But allow his carriage neuer ſo cleare, if it bee either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or ſmell of oſtentation, ſo that one may diſcerne either of them to bee the ſpurre of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, his labour is loſt, will bee
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6321:77"/> imputed to him for vain-glory, and put vpon the account of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. But yet the cenſure of this muſt not be left to the vngouerned tongues of the ignorant multitude, and enuious people; but to men of quality, indifferencie, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The next means of doing good in the Country, wherein mens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours ſhould neuer ſlacke, nor their labours ſeeme troubleſome to themſelues, is in compoſing of differences and diſcontents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one neighbour or friend, and another: it is the principall act of Charitie; by this, they not onely doe, but preſerue it: This is the proper work of a ſuperiour power, mens paſſions will not be ſo much miſgouerned, nor reaſon blinded before them, as betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6321:78"/> or more low arbitrators. It is impoſſible for men to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent iudges in their owne cauſes, their affections will encline, and iudgments leane to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pretenſions. This peruerſeneſſe is it that brings men ſo often to the hazzard of cenſures, and ſuites; which may bee manifeſted in the ſtill continuance of their peeuiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for the murmure remaines when the cauſe is ſentenced, which is the ground of an ill Prouerbe, that <hi>Loſers may lawfully complaine.</hi> And this miſery of imputation is it, which Iudges are forced to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; wherein, in doing iuſtly (for that I admit) impartiall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will bee ſo farre from fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fault, that they loue their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; for a Iudge is to ſentence according to the merit of the cauſe,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6321:78"/> and not to arbitrate in reſpect of collaterall circumſtances. But I will no farther digreſſe. It is the beſt worke wherein a man in the Country can employ himſelfe, to bee a <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> and ender of controuerſies; it confirmes friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; expells malice, auoids need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and extrauagant expences; ſhuts the gate againſt thoſe bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that moue and ſtir ſuits, to make their liuing vpon that prey; expedites cauſes; and makes a more indifferent and ſatisfactory end, then the Iudge in his place can doe. This common good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes ſo worthy an endeuour. And why it is not more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed, I rather impute it to the vnwillingneſſe of interpoſers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a common peruerſneſſe in the parties intereſſed, to ſubmit their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6321:79"/> differences to an vpright and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall neighbour; which his own actions, if conuerſant in this kinde, will ſufficiently aſſure: and I ſee not ſuch difficulty, but it may bee poſſible this way to giue ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to both ſides.</p>
            <p>But if eithers miſtruſt cauſe them not to yeeld to ſo eaſie and quicke an end, the merit of his endeuours and good will cannot bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And if it fall out, that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines be of ſuch a nature, as may iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially afterwards come before him, let not the parties ielouſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in referring it, wreſt or wry his iudgement in the leaſt degree to preiudice. I will enlarge this no farther, theſe particulars laſt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being onely in the power of men of degree and authority; and heere ends my firſt enquiry,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6321:79"/> how a Noble man in the Country ought to carry and gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. I now deſcend to take a ſhort view of the more peculiar delights, and healthfull conueniences, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them that liue in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, then in any other place.</p>
            <p>All field delights, as Hunting, Riding, and Hawking, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, if vſed with moderation, are properly belonging onely to this life, and certainly they greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and actiue mens bodies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the difficulty of enduring la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and other accidents, that in times of warre, a man may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto, more eaſie then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparatiue, or imitable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that I know. The vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the times, early, and late: and ſo the vncertainty of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, heates, and cold, and wet: of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6321:80"/> dyet, little, or none, or courſe, and at houres vnlimited, and not ſet, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured alſo &amp; ready in his horſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by ſo often occaſions of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which is no ſmall aduantage. So paralelling theſe, with the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and neceſſities in time of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; the often vſing of theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, will make the labour leſſe difficill, and hard, when neceſſity of employment ſhall require it, and the body more agill, and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, free from thoſe infirmities, that reſt, idleneſſe, and full feeding doe bring men into. This is the good that followes the vſe of theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, ſetting aſide the delight which drawes moſt men to follow and entertaine them; which ſurely, though not alwayes diſcerned by wiſe men, yet may by good reaſon be proued to be delightfull.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:6321:80"/>
            <p> If I ſhould breathe the country ayre, and digreſſe into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, in reſpect of health from that cauſe, I thinke the whole Colledge of Phyſicions would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to my opinion: for without doubt, it is freed from thoſe noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vapours, and conſequently infections, which thronged and populous Cities doe produce. And this dayly practice makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: for in thoſe Countries where towne-dwelling is moſt frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet euery Summer the better ſort retyre, onely for the freedome, and libertie of the ayre, to their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,</hi> and <hi>Villaes,</hi> as they terme them; which ſhewes there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, and impulſiue cauſe for their health, that driues them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And heere with vs, thoſe that be moſt in loue with the towne, in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:6321:81"/> Summer euer fly into the Country: and the generall reaſon of it muſt onely be, to change a bad ayre, for a good; wherein though the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try doth alwayes predominate, yet in Summer the ayre of the Citie is ſo farre from good, that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tolerable, nor indifferent.</p>
            <p>And being now in a meditation of health, to ſay truth, the helpes, and furtherances of it are much more appropriate to a Country then a Citie life, which I will but touch, without robbing the <hi>Poets</hi> at this time, by falling into the praiſe and pleaſures of <hi>Gardens, Riuers, Fountaines, Woods, places of privacy,</hi> and <hi>retyredneſſe,</hi> or the like: of moſt of which, though all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue a ſhew, yet it is but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and counterfet, in reſpect of them in the country, which is the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6321:81"/> proper element for thoſe delights. But to return to my conſideration of health, the Country is the place moſt free, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that eaſy, &amp; ſedentary life, which men in Cities be forced to entertaine; there all exerciſes for the health, and agilitie of the body bee in dayly practice; as <hi>Riding, Shooting, Bowling, Walking, Hunting, Hawking,</hi> and the like: which though ſome towne-liuers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make hard ſhift to practiſe, yet there, there be ſo many other diuerſions, that there are very few liuing in townes, who can either take or finde opportunities for that purpoſe, which muſt needs great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decay, and diſable both a mans health, and ſtrength. Of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much more might bee ſaid, but I purpoſely auoid it: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede would haue left it out, but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6321:82"/> that I was forced to it in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deſcription, for feare of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from my Title. But I now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to other obſeruations: and firſt, of thoſe aduantages and benefits, a man gaines by liuing in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>A man in the Country is retired out of the crowd and noiſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and emulations, dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and neck-breaking of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which Court, and Town, do too often yeeld, and though a man in his owne inclination bee free from, and not buſie, yet if preſent, can hardly be a neuter: or if he be one, will yet ſcarcely be thought ſo, and ſuſpected of either ſide for affection to the other. But take him allowed for a neutrall, hee then commonly is ſo farre from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſides, that they both
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6321:82"/> turne his enemies, becauſe he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their friends. Theſe ſtraites by being away, and by liuing in the Country, men often eſcape from.</p>
            <p>Next, he is free from thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous winds of buſineſſes, and multiplicitie of vexations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many haue beene toſſed; the calme of the Country being void of thoſe ſtormes, and troubled waues, that commonly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a towne, or Court life, where mens deſires and ambitions ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, that they bee alwayes in hopes, and proiections, wherein many times they doe ſo outſtraine &amp; ouer-graſpe, that in reaching too high, they ouerreach themſelues, in ſeeking a new fortune, loſe their old, and ſo conuert their ſubſtance into pretenſions, their certainty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing.</p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:6321:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Againe, no man can expect to liue in the ſame, or equall reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of the Country, and his owne dwelling. In Towne, or Court, he is as it were, in a throng, wanting elbow roome: there bee ſo many his equals, and ſuperiors, aboue him both in place, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he is reckoned for number, not weight; one of the troope ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſhew, then vſe. Thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore who affect this place, out of vaine-glory, and pride, to ſhew themſelues, and get opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they compare their eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heere, with their reputation at home, they will finde cauſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to change their minde and place, to goe thither where they ſhall be ſure to finde that, which they ſo affectedly deſire, and that is to their owne Country; aske but
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6321:83"/> Northerne men, or Welſhmen, they will ſweare to you this is true.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I beleeue, if it went to voices, moſt would opine, that the ſtabilitie of a Country fortune were leſſe ſubiect to declination, and the cataracts of aduerſitie, then that whoſe onely foundation is built vpon the preſent fauour of the time. They who raiſe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates aboue, the Hauen they ſtriue for, is a Countrey fortune, that is the end of their ambition. When a man therefore hath that which the Courtier onely aymes at: why ſhould hee fix himſelfe in that ſpheare vpon purpoſe, to looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe things, which hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie? If that be not his end, and no other iuſt cauſe can bee alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I cannot free him from the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6321:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> imputations of lightneſſe, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; who beſides the neglecting of that good he may doe at home, offends firſt, againſt his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and next, againſt the Crowne and ſtate of the Kingdome, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reliefe there, for that which he hath vainely, and inconſiderately ſpent; when neither his own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, nor fauour of the Prince, haue forced the neceſſitie of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.</p>
            <p>And writing now as well to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as wiſe men, if through their owne infirmities they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſubiect to the temptations of high, and ambitious deſires, and deſire to abate them: there is no ſuch correctiue as a retyred coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try life. For though in it ſelfe good and great places, where they meete with men that be fit for them, may,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6321:84"/> out of honeſt ends, and for good purpoſes, bee both deſired, and kept: yet when theſe be only wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the greatneſſe, and dignitie of the place, it is an inordinate, and vnruly paſſion, and ought to be ſuppreſſed. If a man therefore in his owne arraignment, finde himſelfe guiltie of ſuch thoughts, and withall bee not ignorant of his owne inabilities, let him auoid thoſe occaſions that may renue his deſires.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, a man that liues in the Country, is more out of the way, and leſſe obuious to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and enuy of buſie and raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous men, ſuch as build vp their owne fortunes vpon others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes: curious inquiſitors into mens liues, and falſe interpreters of their actions, by that way to lay a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6321:85"/> ground for ruining them, and ſo rayſe a ſtep to their owne aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And though a Country Life do not totally conceale a man from theſe that be ſo quick-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet he that takes that courſe, makes them ſeeke farther off, and they often goe not downe, when they finde worke neerer home.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, this kinde of life giues a man more free houres, for reading, writing, and meditation, then the publike towne-liuers can poſſibly allow themſelues; their time in the Country being neither ſo taken away, nor diſtracted, as vnauoidably in towne it muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten be: both by ſeuerall occaſions, to which their owne wils inuite them, and alſo by often beſtowing themſelues, and time, vpon others, out of affection, and reſpect, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6321:85"/> accidents of diuertion, doe more rarely happen in the Country, men being there more free maſters, both of their houres, and diſpoſing of them, then they can be in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. Many more aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges might be found; but it ſufficeth me, if I haue ſaid enough, though not all. But ſeuerall formes, and actions, of our Morall life, haue as well their diſaduantages, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and ſo hath this; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deale, and diſtribute, my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion equally, my now ſearch muſt be to ſet downe the diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous inconueniences that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a Country Life.</p>
            <p>As in the choiſe, and reading of good Bookes, principally conſiſts the enabling and aduancement of a mans knowledge, and learning; yet if it be not mixed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:6321:86"/> of diſcreet, able, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding men, they can make little vſe of their reading, either for themſelues, or the Commonwealth where they liue. There is not a more common Prouerb, then this, <hi>That the greateſt Clerkes bee not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the wiſeſt men,</hi> and reaſon for it, being a very vneuen rule, to ſquare all actions, and conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, onely by booke precedents. Time hath ſo many changes, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, and ſuch varietie of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and opportunities, interue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and mingled, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to goe new wayes, in the old paths; ſo that though reading doe furniſh, and direct a mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it doth not wholly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it. Therefore the neceſſitie of knowing the preſent time, and men, wherein we liue, is ſo great,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6321:86"/> that it is the principall guide of our actions, and reading but ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall. Now this knowledge, which is obtained by conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and acquaintance, muſt bee ſought where it is, and that is in Cities, and Courts, where generally the moſt refined, and iudicious men, be likelieſt to be found: and as reading formes a iudgement, ſo conference muſt perfect it, or elſe it will be lame.</p>
            <p>It muſt then follow, that a meere Country life; if men looke as well to the enriching of their minds, as fortune, is not the way to purchaſe abilitie, and iudgement; for it both ſecludes vs from the knowledge of the Court, and gouernment there, and alſo eclipſeth from our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, the Great men, and guiders of the State, which any
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:6321:87"/> man who deſires to ſtore his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will finde to be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be looked vpon, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ouer often, as the moſt vſefull bookes.</p>
            <p>And this will appeare, if any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or neceſſitie of buſineſſe, force them thither: for they will be then ſo to ſeeke, and imperfect, ſo incongruous in their behauior, and diſcourſe, that they ſcarce know how to doe their buſineſſe, nor they that they goe to, what they would haue. And in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating, ſuch cannot poſſibly guide themſelues, by their owne iudgements, but muſt ſubmit to the direction of others, who many times for want of iudgement be ill choſen; or for want of honeſtie, be worſe aduiſers. So that if any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion happen, it is vnpoſſible for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6321:87"/> Great men alwaies to want them, they be by this long abſence, both vnknowing, vnknowne, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to diſpatch their owne buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes when they happen.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if a man by his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and reading, haue gotten much ſufficiencie, and abilitie, in the knowledge of affaires, then a totall ſequeſtration in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, doth not onely hinder him of that preferment, and honor, which in all likelihood he may arriue too, but robs the State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth where he liues, of an able, and fit miniſter, to doe it ſeruice. Wheras if a man in his own iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment findes that hee may be vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that his firſt looke is at his Countries ſeruice, in that caſe the wilfull retyring, and obſcuring of a mans ſelfe, muſt needs be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6321:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> a fault: for wee are not borne for our ſelues, and to pleaſe onely our owne fancies, but to ſerue the publike in that kinde, and in thoſe places, we be thought moſt fit for.</p>
            <p>So then as it is ill for men, that know their owne ſtrength, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to conceale and hide it: it is alſo certain, that continuall abſence from the face of the world, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an impoſſibilitie in men, though of neuer ſo good wits, to haue capacitie, iudgement, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to vndergoe the charge of any publike employment, either at home, or abroad, if they ſhould be called thereunto: which forceth the ſtate oftentimes to fix their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places vpon men low, and meanely deſcended, and though their induſtry can neuer bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently commended, who wanting
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6321:88"/> thoſe meanes, that in all likelihood the nobler degrees might haue had, and haue notwithſtanding made themſelues more vſefull, and able for their Countries ſeruice: yet it cannot but be interpreted as a diſgrace, and muſt reflect vpon the ill education, and weakeneſſe of knowledge in our Gentry, and Nobilitie; who, mee thinkes, for that onely reſpect ſhould ſtriue, that as they precede others, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, &amp; birth; ſo at leaſt to equalize them in ſufficiencie, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the great trade, and commerce of the world, is in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and receiuing of good turnes, (I meane amongſt men of equall condition.) But a Country Life ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſolitarie, makes a man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capable to receiue, nor of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6321:89"/> to doe one, and ſo they runne out their dayes vnprofitably both to themſelues, and all men beſide, as if they neither had friends, nor were friend to any, which is a hard condition for a man to liue in.</p>
            <p>Alſo it cannot be denyed, but that a mans long abſence from the Court, and Towne, makes him a ſtranger to all paſſages, and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, both at home, and abroad: for a man there will get that by conuerſation, hee will neuer learne either by Letters, or report. Who knowes not, that wiſe men to their friends will ſay that, which they will neuer write to them? Beſides, if a man hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency abroad, hee is tyed to the Towne, being very hard to keepe it, and liue in the Country. Thoſe therefore that thus deſire to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6321:89"/> informe, and enrich themſelues, muſt either liue where it is to bee gotten, or elſe be content with leſſe knowledge, then other men haue. And ſo for the neceſſities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, that may induce a man to liue in towne, for the preſent theſe ſhall ſerue. Now in a word, ſtill ſuppoſing as I begunne, the man that ſhould either liue, or not liue in the Country, to be of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and degree, I will giue my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, how, and in what manner, he muſt diſpoſe himſelfe, and then end.</p>
            <p>In the forming of this ſentence, I will be very ſhort; but firſt lay this foundation, that no man is, or ought to be ſo abſolutely maſter of himſelfe, as to take the liberty of electing that courſe of life, which onely his owne will, and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6321:90"/> gouernes and deſires: but to follow and direct himſelfe in that way, which his owne abilities, and Countries ſeruice, make, and thinke him fit to be diſpoſed vnto: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one principall end of a mans being in this world, to be ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in one kinde or other, to that Kingdome, or Commonwealth where he liues.</p>
            <p>I will therefore firſt ſelect thoſe, whom neceſſitie and conuenience, ſeclude from a Country Life: who are ſuch as be in the place of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie attendance about a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Prince:</hi> or ſuch as finding their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there well eſteemed of; doe for the encreaſe, and continuation of their fauour at Court, giue their attendance: but that obſeruance then ought to proceede rather out of reſpect, and dutie, then particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6321:90"/> and priuate ends: for he is very vnworthy of a Princes fauour (which is freely beſtowed) if in his loue and hearty affection, hee truely, and reciprocally, returne not the beſt of his ſeruice. Others alſo that ſit at the Helme, and haue the charge of great affaires, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the State, are bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reſidence: and ſo ſuch as bee appointed to any iudiciall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Magiſtracie, or any other office, that forceth their preſence in towne: or if a man haue any tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous buſineſſe, or ſuite, that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them vp, and requires there their frequent attendance. And laſtly, it is conuenient, for ſuch to liue about the Towne, and Court, who haue neither ſettled ſtate nor calling in the Country, becauſe a man that hath there nothing to do,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6321:91"/> and little to liue on, can hardly be tyed to a worſe place; whileſt in the meane time liuing abroad, they make better vſe of their time by conuerſation, and knowing of men, as well as bookes, by that way to inable their ſufficiencie, for any employment, publike, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, in Towne, or the Country, that the ſtate, and their owne inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, may in time aduance them vnto.</p>
            <p>And ſo theſe excepted, I thinke that notwithſtanding the conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, allurements, and aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which cauſe moſt men to be ſo much in loue with liuing about the Towne, and Court, the Country to bee the proper ſpheare for all of qualitie beſides. In that place they may doe moſt good, as well by their gouernment, and direction,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6321:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> as hoſpitality, and houſe-keeping. For men of equall rankes, can not altogether bee of equall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that they muſt ſubmit, to the choiſe and opinion of the Prince, and State, and goe on in that path, that they direct them. And though it be true that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt buſineſſe of the State, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly directed and concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, yet moſt they there conſult vpon, is for the common good, and that is the good of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which then ought not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, and left naked. Once allow but that libertie, &amp; there are few Noblemen, or Gentlemen there of qualitie, who will not pick an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue out of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Thoſe therefore whoſe ſeruices be found to be of vſe, and neceſſity there, and haue no other calling to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6321:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> diuert them, are bound not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh that confidence, and truſt, which the State hath repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>But yet it ſeemes very hard, ſo ſtrictly to confine and impriſon a man of ranke, and qualitie; and truely in my opinion, I cannot thinke it to be either reaſonable, or conuenient: for by that meanes their former endeuours would bee loſt &amp; experience abated: therefore I mitigate thus. Their ſettled hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and family muſt needs bee in the Country: but for to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues altogether ſtrangers from the Court and Towne is too ſtrict, and withall not very ſafe for ſuch men to loſe their friends, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at Court, for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of home. Though a man bee not tyed to a continual attendance,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6321:92"/> yet he is to ſome, and if he be but now &amp; then there, his eſtimation, and reſpect, will bee rather more, then leſſe, when hee comes but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So I conclude, ſuch a man ſhould neither be a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> nor <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen,</hi> more in the Country: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at Court; mixed together, but as the Frenchmen doe allay their drinke, three parts water, to one of Wine.</p>

            <p>THere was neuer yet Nation; or people, either Ciuill or Barbarous, that accounted not a <hi>Preſcript</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> for a kinde of diuine thing; and ſuch vnruly and vntamed deſires, as would not be reſtrained by that bridle, haue beene euer eſteemed worthily to ſuffer ſuch puniſhments, whether <hi>Corporall, Pecuniary</hi> or <hi>Capitall,</hi> as the lawes haue inflicted. If the lawes then of men doe deſerue, and indeede worthily, ſuch reuerence, without doubt that Law which a mans Maker layes vpon him, doth beyond the degrees of compariſon merit a farre higher valuation: the particulars whereof be diuers, but the generall head that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends

            </p>
            <p>But this word, and the reuerence alſo due vnto it, hath gone farre; for the very heathen are ſubiect to the power of ſome Religion, and ſubmit themſelues thereunto, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and a number of volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous writers doe manifeſt. So it ſeemes all people haue with one conſent ioyned together, to make this the ground, and <hi>Baſis,</hi> of all their other actions, and lawes, and the foundation or principall Pillar to vphold the reſt, but ſometimes out of Policy, as well as Deuotion: for grant the multitude were awed with the reuerence, and number of their Gods, yet ſometimes the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6321:94"/> Heathen, though they thought it good wiſedome to nouriſh their opinions, yet had not ſo little wit as to beleeue them.</p>
            <p>Briefely now then to know what is meant by <hi>Religion: It is the true knowledge, and true ſeruice of God,</hi> in theſe two conſiſts <hi>Piety:</hi> without them it is maymed and defectiue. The <hi>knowledge of God</hi> is reuealed in the Scriptures, and wrought by faith, which is not <hi>true,</hi> vnleſſe it be certaine, and not mixed with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or doubts. And the <hi>true ſeruice of God,</hi> is a kinde of reſtrained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, within certaine Lawes and Ceremonies, and that either <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> or <hi>outward. Inward,</hi> when a man powres out his ſoule in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Thanksgiuing. <hi>Outward,</hi> in the ſeuerall rites, geſtures, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:6321:94"/>
            <p> Thoſe men therefore, whoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioy conſiſts not in this life, and the period of whoſe hope lies not vpon their death-beds, will be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that their firſt choiſe ſhould be, the <hi>true knowledge of Religion,</hi> which aſſures them of an infinite addition, and continuation of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the life that is to come. This is the houſe built vpon the <hi>Rocke,</hi> this is the corner <hi>Stone</hi> of the building, this is the <hi>Pillar</hi> that will not be moued, in a word, this makes a man vnlike that <hi>Reede</hi> which will bee ſhaken with euery winde.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſeate</hi> of Religion muſt bee in a mans <hi>heart,</hi> conducted thither by the meanes of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> grounded vpon <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the conſent of the <hi>Church.</hi> It is a mans <hi>heart</hi> that iuſtifies him
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6321:95"/> before <hi>God,</hi> his outward <hi>workes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>men,</hi> by which they may gueſſe, but not conclude, ſuch a one to be a godly, and religious man. For if workes alone could iuſtifie; the <hi>Heathen</hi> in their moralitie haue out-gone vs, very <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Impoſtors</hi> goe beyond vs, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> glorifyers of works in their blinde zeale exceede vs. Wherefore as it is vnpoſſible to iuſtifie a man by his <hi>workes,</hi> ſo it is deſperate to iudge a man for his not ſo frequent working, or not working at all, to our knowledge: for keepe true <hi>Religion</hi> within his bounds, that is, in the <hi>heart</hi> of a man, it is poſſible for one to doe the acts of a good man, and yet not to be ſeene, or marked, for feare of being his own Trumpet, and that ſo his good deeds may either taſte of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6321:95"/> or leaſt that his owne heart, (conſidering the frailety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, &amp; that himſelfe hath ſometimes had temptations, and ticklings that way) be puft vp with <hi>Pride</hi> by the Plaudities of other men. This caſe I onely put, not to abridge men of their good and publike acts of charitie; but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the ouer-bold, and common cenſuring that is vſed. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue thus, that as all the beſt, and good deeds, that can be imagined, or were yet euer done, auayle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards a mans ſaluation, without they proceede from a tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and religious heart, yet no man can be truely Religious, that expreſſeth not his faith by his works. By which it is plain, though works be nothing without Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo Religion cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6321:96"/> works; they are ſo vnſeparably linked together, they cannot bee ſeuered.</p>
            <p>There is nothing, if duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that ought to be more deare, and of greater comfort, and hope, to mankinde, then the true ſence, and Religious application, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine myſterie: wee now are, anon are not, when all leaues vs, and we leaue all the world, it is the true ioy wee conceiue by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which doth ſtrengthen vs in death, and immortalize our ſoules. How miſerable were a man, and little aboue the fortune, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a beaſt, being of ſo ſhort, and vncertaine continuance, if hee put not a difference betwixt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; remaining happineſſe? &amp; if he knew not that the knowledge, and ſeruice of God were the onely
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6321:96"/> way to lead to ſo happy an end.</p>
            <p>The inward thoughts, in the high and reuerent eſtimation of God, is the firſt degree of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for onely the formalitie of it, which is but hypocriſie, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparance, is as ill as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme.</hi> Then as we thinke well, ſo neede we to know truely, leſt our good thoughts, and religious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, be miſ-placed by miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>And let no man perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that there is any action, or vertue, comparatiuely, in this world, of equall eſtimation, and power, with Religion. It was the commendation <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> gaue the <hi>Emperour Theodoſius,</hi> that vpon his deathbed, and in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of weakeneſſe, hee tooke more care for the ſtate of the Church,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:6321:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> and preſeruation of Religion, then of his owne extreme dangers and infirmities. And <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> in the preface to his lawes, diſclaimed all confidence in the greatneſſe of his Empire, number of Souldiors, aduice of his chiefe Commanders, and Councell, but relyed onely vpon that prouidence and mercy of God which Religion had taught him; knowing, the neglect of this duty vvould otherwiſe awake Gods Iuſtice and wrath: according to <hi>Horace; Dij mult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:6321:97"/> and no cauſe of the greateſt weight, or that required the moſt ſudden expedition; could precede this; becauſe (it ſeemes) as in al their other actions, they dedicated the beginning of it to religious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip, ſo they would not vary from that cuſtome in their conſultations. And certainly, if an imaginary religion were of ſo great power with them, much more ought we, in the height and certainty of this knowledge, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues thereunto.</p>
            <p>It is excellently obſerued by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Prou.</hi> 29. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>When the righteous are in authoritie, the people reioyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourne.</hi> For certainly the proſperitie, and decayes of States, do very much depend vpon good, and religious gouernments:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6321:98"/> morally good, I dare ſay all ſtories will witneſſe, and that is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid to Religion: and ſo I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>wicked,</hi> in this place, as denominating vertuous, and vicious perſons. But for to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the proſperitie of States hath been euer in thoſe places one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where Religion is truely profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I dare not goe ſo farre. For God did heretofore confine, and yet doth not much enlarge (in reſpect of thoſe ſecluded) the knowledge of Religion to multitudes.</p>
            <p>But where <hi>God</hi> hath declared himſelfe, there good gouernments, if not Religious withall, doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly precede ſome ſtroke of Gods Iuſtice, Knowledge reuealed alwayes requiring obedience ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which ſhould awake the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Superiours, to ſee the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:6321:98"/> ſeruice of God, and true ſubſtance of our Religion, not in name one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to agree, but in truth to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to our profeſſion: not that <hi>God</hi> ſtands in neede of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, and worſhip, but procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from his abundant loue to mankinde, to ſupply our naturall, and ſpirituall neceſſities, which commonly comes not vnbegged, nor ſtayes not vnacknowledged: and this you ſhall euer find, where Religion is not truely eſteemed, and had in due reſpect, mens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners turne ſo depraued, that the force of other lawes can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them.</p>
            <p>This is a law that workes as well vpon the reſtraining of inward thoughts, as outward actions, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the minde, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but our corrupt deſires, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6321:99"/> deeds, if Religion be wanting, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the curbe of lawes, can keepe within bounds: and in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that be forced, there is little aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; ſo that we may conclude, All the vicious, and diſorderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of our conuerſation, ſprings from our ſimplicitie, and neglect in Religion. <hi>Primae ſcele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cauſae mortalibus aegris naturam neſcire deorum.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Silius.</hi>

The beſt can but bee enclined to doe good one to another, but this tyes all ſorts to doe it: take away this bond, and we plunge our ſelues into a ſea of al kinde of miſchiefe. No man, no Prince, no State, can be confident one of another, though wee haue often ſeene pretenders to Religion,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6321:99"/> who make it but their countenance to diſguiſe their deceitfull purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and corrupt thoughts: and yet theſe, me thinks, if they entred into the conſideration of their mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the vaſtneſſe of eternitie, with the ſucceeding happineſſe, or miſeries they muſt endure, they would be more circumſpect in the wayes of their liues, which cauſeth and continues all the good preſent, and to come, they can deſire, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. <hi>Aſpiciunt oculis ſuperi mortalia iuſtis.</hi> So <hi>Ouid:</hi> and <hi>Horace, Qui ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram inertem, qui mare temperat ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſum, &amp; vrbes regna<expan>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6321:100"/> eſtabliſh this vnity, that it may bee ſaid of them, as of the people men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 32. <hi>And the multitude of them that beleeued, were all of one heart, and one ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the politick aduice of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as <hi>Dion</hi> notes it, that in matter of Religion, hee ſhould ſhew all outward deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reuerence, according to the Law, and forme of his Country, and force others to do the like, and that as well in forme, as ſubſtance, in which caſe men are alwaies tyed to the rule of the Law, and bound to obſerue it: which cauſed <hi>Seneca</hi> with more affection then religion to write, that <hi>ſapiens ſeruabit ea tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam legibus iuſſa, non tanquam Dijs grata.</hi> By which you ſee, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and continuing of vnity in Religion, was held a point of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6321:101"/> gouernment &amp; policy. But though it be true, we cannot force religion, becauſe no man is conſtrained to beleeue, whether hee will, or no, and that I ſubſcribe to Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> that <hi>ſides ſuadenda eſt, non impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa:</hi> yet, there is no doubt but that in all Chriſtian good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the people haue been forced to yeeld their outward obedience to the religion publikely profeſſed; otherwiſe ineuitable confuſion would follow, and Religion would grow into contempt. To preuent which, it is better for a time to force men to outward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity though mixt with <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> then ſuffer them to continue refractary.</p>

            <p>OF all ſtudies, either for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or vnderſtanding, I preferre Hiſtory, becauſe by an exquiſite expreſſion it doth ſhew vnto vs the Acts &amp; Councels of precedent times. And it is certain, that where neither Affection, nor Flattery, nor Feare beare ſway, you ſhall finde perfectly delineated the image of truth, without obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or detraction, committed to perpetuall memory the moſt worthy, and nobleſt Acts of Great men, without colouring their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; but leauing both their good and euill to poſteritie, the one for a patterne of Honour, and Vertue, the other for a direction that wee may not follow their ſteps where
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:6321:102"/> they tread awry, leſt wee leaue to our ſelues nothing but an euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing memoriall of infamy, the true property of an Hiſtorian being, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, non falſa, ſcribere ſine oſtentatione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Hiſtories</hi> ſome are <hi>Naturall,</hi> ſome <hi>Ciuill;</hi> of <hi>Ciuill,</hi> ſome concern the ſtate of the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſome, the affaires of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> To them both appertaineth the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>places,</hi> which is <hi>Geography;</hi> of <hi>times,</hi> which is <hi>Chronology;</hi> of <hi>deſcents,</hi> which is <hi>Genealogy;</hi> and of <hi>actions,</hi> which is that I now am to ſpeake of, and is principally, ſingly, and by a kinde of prerogatiue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> And the other three, namely, <hi>Geography, Chronologie,</hi> and <hi>Genealogie,</hi> are but aſſiſtants to the ſame. This kinde of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I hold moſt neceſſarie, &amp; profitable, may bee written either

And this is that Hiſtory that addeth (if it be read with attention and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) ſo muſt ſtrength to a mans <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to reiterate the ſo many and ſo much decantate vtilities and praiſes of Hiſtory, nor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the beſt way to an Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher (the one being a vaine, and needleſſe; the other, a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous taske) but onely to ſhew the meanes how by reading them, to reape moſt benefit for a mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate inſtruction, I thinke that the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:6321:103"/> firſt conſiderable point, is the end wherfore Hiſtory is to be read and held in eſtimation.</p>
            <p>And that is (as is the end of all humane knowledge,) to make a perfect man, namely, of an <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> well informed of what is <hi>true,</hi> and of a <hi>Will</hi> well &amp; conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed to that which is <hi>good.</hi> For whoſoeuer is ſo, wanteth no vertue, or abilitie of the minde that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>To the obtaining of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though this be not the only meanes, yet is it the apteſt, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in particular and applyable examples, what many ſciences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in generall precepts, and ſuch as haue innumerable excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, can hardly comprehend.</p>
            <p>And beſides, though Morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy haue the ſame ſcope and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:6321:103"/> ayme, and hath beene anciently learned, for the prudent, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gouernment of a mans life, and actions: yet at this day the bookes of it afford matter rather to diſpute of wiſedome and vertue, and to define and diſtinguiſh of their natures, and ſorts, then to make a man either wiſe or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
            <p>And though heretofore they were accounted good Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that could ſtraine, and ſlacke the bridle of their paſſions, when, and where they ought: that fear'd turpitude moſt of all things, and death leaſt: that in their deeds could diſtinguiſh betweene two vicious extremes, and walke euenly in the midſt, not for feare of one <hi>Vice,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe as farre as to the other, and finally, that were able to

And though a mans experience of his owne times, may giue him much helpe and direction in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet the knowledge of former times, &amp; applying thoſe accidents which then paſt to the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, muſt needs be the greateſt helpe to inable vs for action, or councell; and is of ſuch profit, that one ſaies, <hi>Hiſtoria, ſi adſit, ex</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The benefit that the <hi>Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> receiueth thence, ariſeth two wayes. Firſt, it becomes enformed, as it were, with matter of fact, by the direct Narration of things paſt, in manner as they fell out. And in this reſpect, Hiſtory is ſaid to be, <hi>Teſtis temporum, Lux veritatis, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia vetuſtatis.</hi> Secondly, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by particular examples, and by the euents of humane counſell, (as by ſo many rules and patterns) to take the wiſeſt courſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting our affaires to their right ends. And for this effect, it is called <hi>Magiſtra vitae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>will</hi> of man, it is alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to goodneſſe thereby, when it heareth recounted the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and vituperation; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:6321:105"/> and puniſhment; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ignominie; the happy, and contrarie eſtates, and ſucceſſes, of good and euill perſons, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes.</p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bare Narration, may the better apprehend, and the <hi>memory</hi> retaine, what is recounted vnto vs of the <hi>men</hi> and <hi>matters</hi> of ſuch times &amp; places as are remote from vs, and the faces of things couered ouer, and ſullied with the duſt of Antiquity, may appeare brighter to our apprehenſion, there muſt bee ioyned to our reading theſe helps.</p>
            <p>Firſt a good <hi>method;</hi> as namely, the <hi>Hiſtorie</hi> of what <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> you will begin with, and with what follow. In which point, this is my opinion, that a man ſhal with beſt ſucceſſe begin, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:6321:106"/> of time, and ſo diſcend with it. And for the principall reading, to take the Hiſtory of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that from time to time liued in moſt flouriſhing, moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and moſt ciuill eſtates: then as it were collaterally, of thoſe people that were the ſame age in aſcent: and laſtly, of ſuch as were then declining, and of leſſe marke, vntill one come to the beginning of the Chronicles of his owne Country. And then it will bee beſt to make that his principall reading, and the reſt as ſecondarie or incident.</p>
            <p>Withall, if there be in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of any generall Story, ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table actions regiſtred in volumes apart, or deſcribed by occaſion of writing the life of ſome great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or States-man, or particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized in the Letters of eminent,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:6321:106"/> and wiſe men; theſe would bee eſpecially, and carefully read in the places where they fall in. As in reading the ſecond <hi>Punique</hi> warre, written by <hi>Liuy,</hi> I fortifie my knowledge, by reading the liues of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch;</hi> or ſtrengthen the Story of <hi>Caeſars</hi> time, with the reading of <hi>Cicero's</hi> Letters to <hi>Atticus;</hi> or in reading the volume of the French Story, when I come to the life of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, I ioyne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is written of him by <hi>Philip Comines,</hi> and the like in like caſes; being commonly more exactly, and with more pertinent circumſtances in theſe manners deliuered. This beeing done, recourſe ſhould againe bee had to the body of the Hiſtory. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I would not wiſh
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:6321:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> a man to bee ſo long abroad, or a ſtranger at home, till hee had read all that precedes the Records of his owne Nation, but rather both in, and beſides the ſet courſe ſpoken of, be conuerſant in them at all opportunities.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Epitomes,</hi> or briefe vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall <hi>Chronicles,</hi> for one that meanes to goe through all the ſingulars, they ſeeme quite vnneceſſary: and for my owne part, I ſhould leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>Epitome,</hi> which is for the moſt part a iuyceleſſe Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then I ſhould the actions, with their needfull circumſtances, ſet down at large in a complete Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which in the beſt <hi>Epitomes,</hi> may rather be ſaid to be lopped of their beſt parts, then contracted in the totall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is required a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:6321:107"/> due, and <hi>diligent obſeruation</hi> of the times and <hi>Chronologie,</hi> when you finde it mentioned, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ſame age, one to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with another in euery point of it; otherwiſe there will want, not onely credit ſometimes to the <hi>Author;</hi> but alſo light to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that which is read. For Relations concurrent, if they agree on the time, both ſtrengthen and enlighten each other, like diuers witneſſes vpon ſeuerall occaſions, depoſing one and the ſame truth. And as the <hi>ſenſe</hi> perceiueth nothing without the circumſtances of time, and place; ſo the <hi>vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (which is the more perfect, as it hath more ſenſible information) without the deſcription of them, conceiueth no buſineſſe cleerely. For they be ſuch circumſtances as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:6321:108"/> make things paſt &amp; gone to come againe, and as it were be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, rather then related.</p>
            <p>And therefore alſo <hi>Coſmography</hi> in the third place, is neceſſarily to be adioyned, as a ſpeciall helpe to vs in the reading of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know the formes and ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the Regions, Seas, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, Hils, Lakes, and the like, euery where mentioned, and the poſtures both of one in reſpect of another, &amp; of each in reſpect of the heauens. For the conſtitution, complexion, manners, and proprieties of their ſeuerall inhabitants, depend not a little thereon. And oftentimes the qualities of the times, and places, diſcouer the reaſon of an euent, when the Author does omit it. So in theſe three obſeruations, namely, of <hi>method, time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:6321:108"/> is contained all that in reading Hiſtory is conſiderable, ſo farre forth as it ſerues to informe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in matter of <hi>fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now for the other more principall vſe of it, that is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and enable the iudgement, and furniſh a man with diſcretion, and wiſedome; theſe things are to be regarded.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the election of Authors, wherein I will not preſume to compare, and preferre one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor before another, (except the ſoueraign compiler of holy Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, between whom and men there is no proportion) by their ſeuerall names, which were a thing both tedious and diſtaſtfull. But yet we muſt be carefull in our choyce, and haue a ſpeciall regard to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that haue written, leſt by too
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:6321:109"/> much credulity wee be led into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. For ſome haue written for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour partially, for feare falſly, for ſpleene ſpightfully; but a diſcreet Reader may eaſily trip them. And in generall, ſuch as you ſhall think to write moſt truely and moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vpon the paſſages of euery Age and Region, you ſhould labour to finde out, and reade ouer. For where truth is wanting, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall want a foundation, whereon to frame to it ſelfe any precept, for inſtitution and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life: <hi>Truth</hi> being the forme and eſſence of Hiſtory, without which it is but the worſt kinde of <hi>Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though it would be hard to finde any one <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> (much leſſe a ſufficient number for all ages and places) wherein there be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6321:109"/> not ſome vntruths, yet this ought not either to deterre the Reader, or diſgrace the Author, where the mayne and beſt part is truely ſet downe, but onely to moue a man to chooſe <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> thoſe that haue feweſt fables, and moſt ſinceritie in the maine drift. And ſeeing that euery relation is a ſtory, a man may runne ouer thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are falſe, and fabulous, without preiudice to the profit he ſhall receiue from the reſt. As for example, though he lightly paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the many ſuperſtitious Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of miracles, and prodigies writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Liuy,</hi> and other good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet he may gather excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his labour, by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obſeruing their principally intended ſcope; namely, the true, and ample Narration of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6321:110"/> deeds of whom they writ.</p>
            <p>Another thing to make choiſe of in a Writer, is <hi>fulneſse.</hi> Herein hee is not moſt to bee commended that hath moſt words, but rather he that relates moſt in feweſt words: for ſome are large by digreſſions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing vpon, and cenſuring the actors, and acts, as they leaue the Stage. Some miſlike this, as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (it may be) from vaine-glory, or preſumption, to anticipate the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Reader, to whom, and not to the Writer, that part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. But I am of this minde, that if it bee done by a wiſe <hi>Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> and ſuch as hath been exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in great affaires, whatſoeuer his intent is, (which is to be iudged to be the bettering of his Reader) a man ſhould eſteeme himſelfe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him the more, as to one that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6321:110"/> goes out of his owne way, to ſhew another his. Beſides, ſo many anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and wiſe compilers of great Hiſtories, vſe thus to digreſſe, that for a man of this age to tax them for it, were to taxe himſelfe of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some fill many leaues together with Orations, which though they are but the inuention oft-times of the Writer, and therefore declare not what was ſaid; yet they ſhew what might be fitly ſaid for ſuch a purpoſe, entring herein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the Orator, for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is the thing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould ayme at, and not the cenſuring of the compoſer.</p>
            <p>But thoſe, whoſe volumes grow, by a care not to omit any neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie circumſtance that accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great, and remarkeable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6321:111"/> ſhould be your chiefe electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For this diligence in Hiſtories is ſo needfull, as without it there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth no profit at al to the Reader. As for examples ſake, Where it is regiſtred, that ſuch a King in ſuch a place, ſuch a time began his reigne, reigned ſo long, builded ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; was ſucceeded by ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I cannot imagine what benefit I ſhould draw hence for my inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or how I am the wiſer for it; onely I may receiue the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of knowing ſo much, which is a very ſmall purchaſe.</p>
            <p>But the deſcription of armies ſet in array, after this, or that manner, the placing of Ambuſhes, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Marches, the taking in, or preoccupying of aduantageous places, the beleagring, oppugnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expugnation and defending of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6321:111"/> ſtrong holds, the diuerſities of ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and ſuch like, in matter of Warre: the occaſions, and effects, of good and euil lawes, the ſtirring, the maintaining or appeaſing of ſeditions, and conſpiracies, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or imprudency of wiſe, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Senators, in conſulting, or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the humours and cuſtomes of Princes, and great Commanders, and ſwayers of State, and the like, in adminiſtration of Republikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truely and liuely related vnto vs, are the things that ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the enabling of our <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>[Vrbem</hi> Romam <hi>à principio Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges habuere. The Citie of</hi> Rome <hi>was at the firſt gouerned by Kings]</hi> The firſt forme of gouernment in any State is accidentall: that is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the condition the Founder happens to be of. If one man of abſolute power aboue the reſt, bee
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:6321:119"/> the Founder of a Citie, he will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be the Ruler of the ſame; if a few, then a few will haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment; and if the multitude, then commonly they will doe the like. And it is but iuſtice, for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to haue his owne worke ſubiect to his owne will. So here <hi>Romulus</hi> built, and ruled; was the founder, and was the King. The building of this Citie was about 800. yeeres before the Natiuitie of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and conſequently from that time to this preſent, about 2420. The Contemporaries of <hi>Romulus</hi> reigning in <hi>Iuda,</hi> were <hi>Iotham;</hi> in Iſrael, <hi>Pekaiah;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Medes, Artycas;</hi> in <hi>Macedonia, Thurimas;</hi> in <hi>Athens, Charops,</hi> who began the ten yeeres gouernment there inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; in <hi>Lacedemon, Polidorus;</hi> and in <hi>Italy</hi> there were many petty
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:6321:120"/> States, of might not much vnequal, whereby this new Citie might the ſafelier grow vp amongſt them, and bee the ſoonerable to match the moſt of them. For if any of thoſe States had been of eminent power aboue the reſt, it is likely, <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not haue beene ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue encroched ſo faſt on her neighbours.</p>
            <p>Now we haue ſeene the times in which this Citie was built, let vs next view how many Kings ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely reigned ouer it, and how long this gouernment continued. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The next gouernment of this State, was <hi>Conſulary. [Libertatem &amp; Conſulatum</hi> Lucius Brutus <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit. Liberty and the Conſulſhip</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Brutus <hi>brought in.]</hi> Euery one that hath read the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, can tell how much this act of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Brutus</hi> hath beene magnified, inſomuch as they inſtituted in the honour of it, an Holiday, by the name of <hi>Regifugium:</hi> and how the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:6321:121"/> imitation of it drew another of the ſame race, and name, into ſuch another action, who came not off with the like applauſe, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with the like fate. But I ſhall neuer thinke otherwiſe of it then thus; <hi>Proſperu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; foelix ſcelus Virtus vocatur.</hi> For it was but a priuate wrong, and the fact not of the King, but the Kings Sonne, that <hi>Lucretia</hi> was rauiſhed. Howſoeuer, this, together with the pride, and tyranny of the King, gaue colour to his expulſion, &amp; to the alteration of gouernment. And this is by the Author entitled, Liberty, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe bondage is alwayes ioyned to Monarchy; but where Kings abuſe their places, tyrannize ouer their Subiects, and wink at all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and abuſes, committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by any either of their
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:6321:121"/> children, or fauorites, ſuch vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation ouer mens eſtates, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, many times breakes forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to attempts for liberty, and is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endured by mans nature, and paſſion, though reaſon and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on teach vs to beare the yoke. So that, it is not the gouernment, but the abuſe that makes the alteration be termed Liberty. This <hi>Conſula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> gouernment began about <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3422. not long after the beginning of the ſecond generall Monarchy, which was of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> amongſt whom reigned <hi>Cambyſes, Xerxes,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> all within the ſpace of fiftie yeeres, or thereabouts. And in the <hi>Athenian</hi> State liued <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> in thoſe dayes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>Now during this Conſulary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:6321:122"/> there were others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt. [Dictaturae <hi>ad tempus ſumeban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Dictators <hi>were choſen but vpon occaſion.]</hi> This Magiſtrate, for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was limited onely by his owne will. For time, hee had limits from the <hi>Senate,</hi> and thoſe ſo ſhort, that their power could doe little hurt, and bred little ambition. They had now authoritie like abſolute Kings, and by and by had no more then a King in a Play. But when it came to the hands of ſuch as could not eaſily be conſtrained to lay it downe, they found it of that power, that by the colour thereof the people were bereaued of their liberty, and enthralled to <hi>Sylla</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pleaſure, and to <hi>Caeſar</hi> during life. But the <hi>Dictatorſhip</hi> is not to bee accounted another forme of gouernment, but onely an Office

They were iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their liberty, and knew not in whoſe hands to truſt it, and were often at the point to loſe it: but at this time licentious and inordinate luſt gaue them once more an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhake off the yoke. As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> ſo now the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri</hi> ſuffer for the ſame offence.

This alteration in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment began 58. yeeres after the expulſion of Kings, about <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3500.

And when a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and free people, is ſubdued to the tyrannie of one man, it is for the moſt part after ſome long and bloudie Ciuill Warre. For ciuill warre is the worſt thing that can happen to a State: wherein the height of their beſt hopes can come but to this, to venture &amp; haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their own, to ouerthrow their friends and kindreds fortunes. And
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:6321:127"/> they that are at the worſt, haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to bee content with, and wiſh for any change whatſoeuer. This was one occaſion which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> laid hold of to eſtabliſh the Monarchy, they were weary, their ſtrength abated, and their courages foyled.

Of this humour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> retained onely thus much at this time, that hee tooke a title which ſignified not authoritie, but dignitie before all the reſt: as if
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:6321:127"/> the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had beene to be numbred one by one, hee thought himſelfe worthy that they ſhould begin with him. Alſo hee knew that the multitude was not ſtirred to ſedition ſo much, with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie power, as inſolent Titles, which might put them to conſider of that power, and of the loſſe of their libertie. And therefore hee would not at the firſt take any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue Title, as that of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Dictator,</hi> which for the abuſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done, were become odious to the people. And in a multitude, ſeeming things, rather then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, make impreſſion. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten the mayne thing that he aſpired vnto, to giue them then content in words, which coſt him neither money, nor labour, hee thought no deare bargaine. And
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6321:128"/> this was but for the preſent neither. For he doubted not but that the power which hee had in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, would in time dignifie any name hee ſhould take aboue the name of <hi>King:</hi> and in the meane ſpace hee ſhould keepe the loue of the people, which is the principall pillar of a new ſoueraignty.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, the ſeuerall changes and alterations in the ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and how the ſway thereof, after the ſpace of almoſt 800. yeere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now arriued at her greateſt ſtrength, remained wholly in the perſon of <hi>Augustus Caeſar.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after much deliberation had, whether he ſhould reſtore it againe to the former libertie of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or conuert the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment into a Monarchy, at length reſolued on the latter. The

And therefore it much concerned the ſurety of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his gouernment, to haue alſo them content with this
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:6321:141"/> alteration: which they were for two cauſes. Firſt, a <hi>Popular State,</hi> if the great men growe once too mighty for the lawes, is to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces not as one, but many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; ſo that not knowing to which faction to adhere, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the enimitie alwayes of ſome, and ſometimes of all, and become ſubiect to the rapine of whoſoeuer firſt ſeazeth it, and to be the prize of their contention. At home they are commanded by contrary factions, contrary Acts, ſo that they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obey, nor diſobey without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: but are hurried, and haled, ſomtimes to this faction, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to that. Thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to do iuſtice amongſt them, muſt not adminiſter the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, but according to the humour of him, whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:6321:142"/> followeth; which may bee now one, and anon (fortune chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging) another. At <hi>Rome,</hi> if they ſued for any thing, though they could all bee content their ſute ſhould paſſe for the matter it ſelfe; yet the furtherance that one facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould giue it, would ſtirre vp contradiction in the other, and ſo croſſe it. Therefore it is better for a Prouince to bee ſubiect to one, though an euill maſter, then to a potent, if factious, Republique. Next, they found couetouſneſſe in the Magiſtrates. For when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that hauing truth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity on their ſides, their cauſes, and ſutes ſhould not goe amiſſe, they found contrarily, that by that, their iudgements were not ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but that they diſtributed iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice rather by weight then mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:6321:142"/> That purſe that was heauieſt, that bribe that was greateſt, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the cauſe Iuſtice was not ſeene, but felt; a good bribe was their beſt Aduocate. Such in thoſe times were the Magiſtrates, and Iudges. Euery thing was carried by might, ambition, and corruption. He that was not ambitious, was neglected: and he that was not corrupt, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed vndiſcreete. In this time the Prouinces would haue beene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with a Monarchy, or tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, rather then to be troubled with ſo different, and ill humours of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men. But there may alſo be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe in Magiſtrates, when one hath the ſoueraignty, being a fault of the perſon, and not of the forme of the gouernment. Indeed, there may bee bribing in ſuch a State; but in a factious, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:6321:143"/> Commonwealth it cannot bee otherwiſe. For where the State is vnited, the Magiſtrates will haue ſome reſpect vnto that; but being diuided, euery one is for himſelfe, and muſt looke to ſtrengthen and enrich himſelfe by any meanes how ill ſoeuer. For <hi>faction</hi> hath no ſtrength, but from <hi>Iniustice,</hi> and <hi>Rapine.</hi> One remedy there is for ſuch an inconuenience, and that is, if the Lawes bee ſtrengthned with authoritie; which alſo wanted in the former times. For force, friends, and mony ouerthrew their validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For what Law was ſo ſtrong, that the force of <hi>Cinna, Sylla, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Iulius Caeſar,</hi> and others, in their times could not haue broken tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? Nothing is more prouerbiall, then that Lawes are like Spiders webs, onely to hold the ſmaller
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:6321:143"/> Flyes. Then, fauour and friendſhip, made way euen for the weake men to breake thorow. And laſtly, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney gaue the eaſieſt paſſage of all. Wherefore the Prouinces, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing better hope of the rule of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> could not diſlike, but were rather glad of the alteration. Thus farre the acquiſt and aſſurance of the Monarchy to <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> now, his wayes to perpetuate the ſame, and deriue it to poſterity; are to be conſidered.</p>

So <hi>Auguſtus</hi> doth now, and adorns with offices, and dignities, all thoſe vpon whom, he thought, he might make the Empire to diſcend. Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſucceſſors, in the life time of a Prince (beſides that it is a kinde of duty they owe their Country, thereby to preuent ciuill diſcord) hath this vertue, that it nippeth in the head, and killeth the ſeedes of ambitious, and traiterous hopes in thoſe that thinke of alteration: whereas the vncertainty of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeder, breedeth, and feedeth Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in aſpirers for many yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If any man therefore had

This was one ſtay and ſtrength of his gouernment, to put into the hands of his Nephew (as I may ſo ſay) the Supremacy in matters Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, which is one of the chiefeſt guides of a Commonwealth.</p>

Wherein
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6321:145"/> we may perceiue, that in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when a Prince hath a Miniſter of valor, and worth, which may make him capable of great place, the meaneneſſe of his birth ought to be no barre to his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Againe, in raiſing him, firſt he ſhould not neede to feare that hee might enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger him, being one that could preſume ſo little of his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For a man that by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue raiſeth himſelfe from out of the common people, ſhall more often get enuy from the multitude, then any popular applauſe, and conſequently cannot be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.

This is the reaſon that Princes are ſo ſlow in aduancing ſome men, that haue deſerued it;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:6321:147"/> becauſe they cannot eaſily doe it according to their full merit, or elſe they thinke it will not be ſo taken: So that they ſhould, by rewarding them, both pay, and yet remaine in debt. And generally all men, but Princes moſt of all, hate acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, &amp; like not to haue ſuch great Creditors in their eye; but will rather bee content to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage againſt them, as againſt ſo many vpbraiders of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: So that great ſeruices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure many times rather the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred then the loue of him they are done vnto.

Which act of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as it proceeded out of affection, ſo it alſo agreed with good policy; for whom ſhould hee more truſt, then one whoſe loue had beene ſo much ſhewed, whoſe fidelity ſo much tryed?

The reaſon hereof is this, the hopes of Subiects being much built vpon the life of their Prince: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he dyes, they are of neceſſity to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and lay their foundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in the next. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being ready to leaue his room to another, there could not chooſe but bee much diſcourſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the ſucceeder. One of theſe three was of neceſſity to come in place: Liberty, Ciuill warre, or a new Monarch. If ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monarch then either <hi>Agrippa,</hi> or <hi>Tiberius.</hi> For Liberty they had no hope at all, but yet that was alſo talked of: for men haue generally

From which preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded power, the Popes now take to themſelues ſupremacie in all cauſes, through all Kingdomes in the world, and thoſe which were before, their ſuperiours, to bee as it were ſubiect, and created by them that were their creatures. Which ſhewes a great contrariety to the pretended arguments of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> for ſuperiority, and rather may bee returned vpon them, that this their greatneſſe hath more riſen by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:6321:172"/> then right.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If you obſerue the <hi>ſituation,</hi> it ſtands in a place that could neither afford pleaſure nor profit to the dwellers, other then that which is forced. Though not ſo ſeated, as it may bee ſaid to ſtand in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penine,</hi> yet amongſt thoſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. All the Country about is ſo barren, except ſome little, neere the City, which is by labour brought to fertility, that the wildeſt Forreſt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:6321:173"/> of England may be eſteemed good ground, in reſpect of this. In ſome places heereabout, I ſaw where corne had beene gathered, but by the ſtubble might perceiue had beene ſo thinne, that a man would thinke one ſtalke had beene afraid of another. The wayes thereabout both comming downe the <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Naples,</hi> ſo vnpaſſable for a Coach, that a man may think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe well bleſt, if hee breake not his necke from horſebacke.</p>
            <p>The ſight of this ſo miſerable a Country, wonderfully diſtracted my thoughts, to thinke how the inhabitants of ſo wilde a place could euer come to ſuch a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And from thence proceeded theſe cogitations. Firſt, that eaſe and delicacie of life is the bane of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:6321:174"/> noble actions, and wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. A man that is delighted, and whoſe affections bee taken with the place wherein hee liues, is moſt commonly vnapt, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to bee drawne to any change, and ſo conſequently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for any enterpriſe, that may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduance his owne honour, or the good of his Country. Any actions that reach farther then their owne priuate contents, in their eſtimation bee needleſſe and vnprofitable Labours. And it hath many times happened, that whilſt men liue in this Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that Countries, Cities, their owne fortunes and all, haue beene loſt through their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>Againe, a life of pleaſure doth ſo beſot and benumme the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:6321:174"/> ſences, and ſo farre effeminate the ſpirits of men, that though they bee naturally prone to an actiue life, yet cuſtome hath brought them to ſuch a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, that they apprehend not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing farther then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of their owne affections; thinke nothing beyond their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enioyments. A ſtrange <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi> opinion, that men, who were borne to haue dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all creatures; ſhould be now ſubiect to them, and vnder their rule. A meere inuerſion of the prime ordinance.</p>
            <p>From this conſideration I decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the contrary, that a place of hardneſſe, and a life exerciſed in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of valour and not idleneſſe, hath euer produced the braueſt men, &amp; arriued at the greateſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:6321:175"/> Let but the <hi>Romane</hi> Story be a mirrour to you in this kind, you ſhall hardly, I thinke, finde in the firſt times any enterprize of great worth, that the cauſe of it might not be drawne from this head. For their firſt pouerty, being men brought to this place by fortune, and rather by forced, then deſired election, not knowing where elſe to ſettle, in deſpight of want, their ambitions put them forward; firſt, to encroach vpon their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and then, as their fortunes were enlarged, to goe on in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of greater conſequence and more difficulty. Being a race of ſuch men, as could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and limit themſelues to one place, but ſucceſſiuely from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſonne, you ſhall ſcarce reade of any, that was not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:6321:175"/> a man of action or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though ſome peraduenture naturally vnapt for the one, yet exquiſite in the other: and abilitie to giue counſell, is at leaſt, not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the former.</p>
            <p>To prepare a man fit for both, nothing ſo much preuailes, as a hard and weary life, ſuch an agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as will not permit idleneſſe, nor the minde to ſettle too much vpon priuate ends, which being ſo, could neuer be aptly applyed for Publique. Beſides, a continuall working of the mind, which in an actiue ſpirit, will ſtill grow and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in production of good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, if it ſhould be ſuffered to reſt, would ſoone degenerate. For if a man giue ouer himſelfe to an eaſefull life, the ſharpneſſe of his ſences will be dulled, and grow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:6321:176"/> applying himſelfe to his owne contents, and then, can neuer haue ſufficiency, nor will to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile for the publique, once being confined to his own particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and looking no further. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are naturally giuen to ſuch a life, and ſome by accident fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, but certainly their memory dyes with them: for no man is borne onely for himſelfe. This is ſo well knowne, that I will not ſeeke farther to illuſtrate it.</p>
            <p>A third conſideration that came into my minde, at the ſight of the place, was to wonder at a ſort of men (but either ignorant, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious) who from the ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction thinke to calumniate, the valours, and vertues of men, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing their Country for barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for pouerty, or the like. Theſe
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:6321:176"/> men, if they had euer ſeene this place, and known the ſtory, would neuer haue imagined this a good argument. Cannot vertue and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie be together? cannot an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull Country yeeld men full of worthineſſe, and Valour? a ſtrange marke of an enuious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to taxe the mens vertues, for the vnpleaſantneſſe of the ſoyle; as if vertue and plenty could not bee ſeuered, or that of neceſſity a hard Country muſt produce ſoft and ignoble ſpirits: but if they would truely looke into themſelues, they could not chooſe but ſee a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull imperfection, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, who iudge vertue by means, and men by places. If Noble and worthy Spirits had conſiſted in theſe outward reſpects, the men of this place would haue beene won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:6321:177"/> ignominious; but you may plainely ſee, by the example of them, that a poore and hard life, a deſolate, and almoſt vninhabitable place, brought forth ſuch men, and they performed ſuch actions, as in this age (we are moſt of vs ſo much degenerate) we can hardly heare of without incredulitie. So I wil leaue the place it ſelfe, and ſpeake of the Country about it.</p>
            <p>Not farre diſtant from the Citie, is the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, and the principall Port now is <hi>Ciuita vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> where ſince the Church hath had dominion, the Nauy is very ſmall, and chiefely conſiſts of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But certainly, this was a great helpe, in the time of the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> as well to encreaſe their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, as to fortifie themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt forraine inuaſions: for by
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6321:177"/> this meanes men were more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with leſſe charge tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> where they made great conqueſts, which otherwiſe could neuer haue been compaſſed, and they themſelues much ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt all enemies that could come from thoſe parts, ſeeing it a matter of great difficultie to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, or take any place, that hath ſo good a defence as the Sea. And to a people who bee ſtrong, and of great power, it is not difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues from the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of any aſſaylers; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath euer ſhewn, it is harder to conquer <hi>Ilands</hi> &amp; places well fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the Sea, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Continent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for this, and now I will confine my ſelfe within the walles, which bee the ancient ones,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:6321:178"/> adorned in former times with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny towers, but now the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and not very many left. The Riuer <hi>Tyber</hi> runnes thorow the towne, and within this compaſſe are thoſe ſeuen Hilles ſo famouſly knowne, all of one ſide the Riuer, vpon which old <hi>Rome</hi> was built. And ſtill there bee ſome Palaces on them; but the Citie, as it is now, is more built in thoſe ſpaces, as <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> &amp;c. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were left vacant.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But I will now take a view of the ancient Antiquities; and firſt, of the famous Capitoll vpon one of the ſeuen Hils, called <hi>Mons Capitolinus,</hi> whereof almoſt nothing remaines but the memory. The place where the <hi>Senate</hi> ſate, is now plaine, and couered with earth, onely ſome ſteps you may ſee where they went
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:6321:178"/> down, &amp; it is ſaid to haue been fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the form of a Cock-pit. The houſes now about the <hi>Capitol</hi> are aſſigned for the place of Iuſtice. Three ſeuerall aſcents there be by ſtaires vnto it; and I haue heard thoſe <hi>Romanes,</hi> who are deſcended from the Ancient, doe (though at any price) deſire to haue their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereabouts. The principall of them bee of the <hi>Scipioni,</hi> and the <hi>Camilli.</hi> From this place <hi>Nero</hi> made a Gallery to his Palace vpon <hi>Mons Palatinus,</hi> whereof there is now nothing remaining, but ſome few Pillars which bore it vp, very great ones, and of Marble. This place is adorned with many choiſe Statues, both in the open place, and buildings about it. In the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place you ſhall ſee a Statue, lying vpon a Marble ſtone in a fountaine, called
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:6321:179"/> 
               <hi>Marforius, (Paſquins</hi> Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.) There is alſo the Statue of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> in braſſe, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on horſebacke, not anciently here, but remoued hither from a more obſcure place, by <hi>Paulꝰ III. P. M.</hi> Beſides, there is the Statue of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Comedian,</hi> repreſented as if ſhe were ſpeaking, and two Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors liſtning vnto her, ſo liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that a man not inſtructed, may eaſily know they were made for this repreſentation. In the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings there be alſo many principall Statues, as one of a <hi>Scolding Woman,</hi> ſo well done, as it would almoſt feare one to looke on it. A <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> in Braſſe. <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> in Marble. <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſucking a Wolfe, in Braſſe. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> on horſebacke, in Braſſe, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in Marble. Of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:6321:179"/> 
               <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus</hi> ſucking a Wolfe there be many in <hi>Rome,</hi> and not defaced, being euer left by them that ſacked it, to put the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in minde of their baſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But it ſeemes, in this reſpect, they neuer thought the worſe of themſelues, ſeeing they haue in ſo many publike places made repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of this. There is beſides, the Statue of <hi>Nero's</hi> Mother, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her countenance of ſorrow is expreſſed, when the newes of her ſonnes vnnaturalnes meant to her was told. There is another in braſſe, of a Boy, taking a thorne out of his foot, looking ſo earneſtly, &amp; pitifully, that a man would thinke he had ſome ſenſe of paine. There be in this place many other Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of this kinde, which to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid prolixity, I omit to name.</p>
            <pb n="344" facs="tcp:6321:180"/>
            <p> Deſcending from the <hi>Capitol,</hi> there be three or foure <hi>Triumphant Arches</hi> dedicated to the honour of Emperours, as to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> where be engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their principall Acts, &amp; victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but the moſt remarkeable of theſe, is <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> erected vpon his returne from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where you ſhall ſee the ouercomming of the Citie, liuely ſet forth, and the holy things which hee brought away from thence in triumph, as the <hi>Candleſticks</hi> and the reſt ſingularly expreſſed. Here is alſo the great <hi>Amphitheater,</hi> but now extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruinate, where the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſhewes and ſports were vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhewne. Vpon <hi>Mons Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> where <hi>Nero's</hi> magnificent houſe was built, there is nothing to be ſeene but decayes, and now
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:6321:180"/> employed to a Vineyard, which is beſtowed vpon the <hi>Engliſh Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> At the foot of the farther part of this hill is the place, where, vpon great Feaſts, the <hi>Nauall Battailes</hi> were wont to be preſented. Not far from thence is the <hi>Pantheon</hi> or <hi>Rotonda,</hi> in <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> a place built round and high: at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance are many Marble pillars of great thickneſſe, and height, hauing one onely light in the top like a Louuer. This anciently was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dedicated to <hi>all the Gods,</hi> and now conuerted to the honour of <hi>all Saints.</hi> The two Pillars that be erected as Triumphs to <hi>Traian</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> are of a great height, and exquiſitely engrauen vpon the ſides, with their acts and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. Vpon the toppe of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,</hi> his aſhes are ſaid to bee in a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:6321:181" rendition="simple:additions"/> ball of gold. In the houſe of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo Suderetti,</hi> is the place where <hi>Caeſar</hi> made his Tombe, whereof now almoſt nothing remaineth but the ruines: this he purpoſed not onely for himſelfe, but his Family; it is a great compaſſe, built round, and ſome old pieces of the Tombe yet remaine. In many places of this Citie, there are to bee ſeene the ruines of the ancient Emperours Baths; amongſt which, the moſt principall are thoſe of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> of a wonderfull great compaſſe. Vpon this, it is ſaid, that for twelue yeres together, multitudes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were condemned to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall working. Some part of it now is conuerted to a Church and Monaſterie. Without <hi>Porta Pincia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> there is the Temple of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which ſtands vpon Marble pillars,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:6321:181"/> and it is a faire <hi>Rotonda.</hi> Here his Sepulcher is ſet about with pillars, and the tombe it ſelfe is of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry curiouſly grauen. This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is now diuided into two parts, and dedicated to two Saints, Saint <hi>Agnes</hi> and Saint <hi>Conſtanza,</hi> whoſe bodies haue beene there lately found, and that of Saint <hi>Agnes</hi> is ſaid to be vncorrupt. This Temple was of late all couered with earth, and but newly diſcouered. By <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Oſtia</hi> there is a Tombe of one <hi>Ceſtius</hi> an <hi>Aedile,</hi> which was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient office amongſt the Romanes, principally to looke to burialls. This is built in manner of a <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> all of great and broad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, halfe in the wall and halfe out. In many places there be <hi>Pyramides</hi> ſet vp, which are ſaid long ſince to be brought out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> of theſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:6321:182"/> you ſhall ſee at <hi>Santa Maria Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giore, Saint Peters,</hi> and other places. There is moreouer no houſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth, that is not repleniſhed with infinite numbers of ancient Statues; ſo that a man might think, in reſpect of the number, that in ancient time the inhabitants were employed about nothing elſe. Courts, Galleries, euery roome is adorned with them, and in many roomes heaped one vpon another, there bee ſo many. And yet, for all this multitude, it is a ſtrange thing to ſee at what ineſtimable prices they hold euery one of them; nay, it is almoſt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, by any meanes, or for any money to get one of them away, they hold them in ſo great eſtimation. Neuertheleſſe, euery day amongſt their Vineyards, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:6321:182"/> in the ruines of old <hi>Rome,</hi> they finde more, which, in whoſe ground ſoeuer they be found, at a certaine price, doe now belong to the <hi>Popes,</hi> who diſtribute them in their own Palaces, to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites or kinſmen, and ſomtimes as preſents to Princes. And this is the cauſe that the houſcs of ſuch as haue beene Nephewes or fauorites of the <hi>Popes;</hi> bee beſt furniſhed with theſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould make an exact relation of the <hi>Anticaglie</hi> in this kinde, he muſt haue ſeuen yeares time to view, and two mens liues to write them. But for a taſt and ſo away. At the <hi>Popes</hi> Palace, at Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> the Statues of <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> the Statue of <hi>Laocoon,</hi> which is written of by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:6321:183"/> ſecond booke of his <hi>Aeneads;</hi> and they ſay that his very ſeeing of that Statue, was the cauſe of thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the Statue of <hi>Apollo:</hi> and in the middeſt of this place the thigh of a man done in Marble, which the beſt workmen haue iudged ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in the true proportions; and they ſay that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> ſtood two dayes by it in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and the artifice was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and beyond his apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he had like to haue gone mad with the conſideration of it. In this place there bee many more Antiquities, the great Pine Apple of braſſe, wherein were found <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians aſhes.</hi> At the <hi>Popes</hi> other Palace vpon <hi>Mons Quirinalis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gate, there be two other Statues done in full proportion, of <hi>Alexander,</hi> taming <hi>Bucephalus,</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:6321:183"/> made by thoſe two famous men <hi>Phydias</hi> and <hi>Praxiteles,</hi> one in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of the other. And from theſe two Statues being ſet heere, this place is called <hi>Monte Caualli.</hi> In the Garden of <hi>Cardinall Borgheſe</hi> without <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> there is a Tombe which is ſaid to be <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> In the Palace of <hi>Cardinall Ferneſe,</hi> amongſt an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Antiquities, there be the Statues of the twelue firſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, two Tables of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Lawes, which the <hi>Romanes</hi> brought from thence, one of the gods which is ſaid to haue giuen anſwers in the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> a Statue of the two ſonnes of a King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> after the death of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tying his Concubine to a Bull, in reuenge of thoſe wrongs ſhee had done their mother, (this
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:6321:184"/> Story is ſaid to bee related by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertius</hi> and <hi>Pliny)</hi> brought to this City by the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> out of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> found in the time of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> III. of the <hi>Ferneſian</hi> family, and by him left as a relique to this houſe.

            <p>Now from theſe ancient ruines of <hi>Temples, Trophies, Statues, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Columnes Pyramides,</hi> &amp; the reſt, there would be required in a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pen a particular obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but I will only preſcribe vnto my ſelfe ſome generall notes.

When actions of note bee regiſtred, the bare after-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, without ſeeing the place whence they proceeded, is by many men not ſo conſtantly retained in memory. For euery man knowes, that if in reading an Hiſtory (onely by a Mappe) the place bee obſerued as well as the action, ones iudgement is better ſtrengthened, and conſequently much more when a man ſees that which others haue but by deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They that haue read of <hi>Antoninus, Traian,</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and finde their acts which they haue read, engrauen in <hi>Arches, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and the like, it is hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe what credit they giue to the Hiſtory, and ſatisfaction to the Reader. And if in this reſpect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place in the world deſerue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:6321:185"/> none can ſooner claime it then <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the ancient Statues of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> do ſtrangely immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize their fame; and it is certaine that the men of thoſe times were infinitely ambitious, to haue their memories in this kind, recorded; &amp; ſuch was the benignity of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they willingly yeelded to honour their acts, by publique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and in a kind, to Deifie the perſons of their worthieſt men, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> induſtry of theirs may bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the numbers of Statues of <hi>Cicero, Seneca, Brutus, Caſsius,</hi> the <hi>Horatij,</hi> and <hi>Curiatij, Cato,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, whoſe vertue, more then their greatneſſe, made them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. Otherwiſe if I had onely ſeen the Statues of the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, and ancient Emperours, I
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:6321:186"/> ſhould haue thought there had been in thoſe times as great Time-ſeruers, as there be now, where power &amp; authority is more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, then vertue, or valour. Yet I think, if euer men of any place, in any time deſired to haue their names and actions to continue to Poſterity, not knowing any farther immortalitie, theſe were they, and this one conſideration produced better effects of vertue and valour, then Religion, and all other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects doe in our dayes. Certainly, therefore, if they had been as well inſtructed in Diuine, as Morall precepts, no man of any age had euer exceeded them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the multitude and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of theſe Statues, and other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, do wonderfully argue the magnificence of thoſe times, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:6321:186"/> they haue exceeded all that went before, or followed after them; and yet this ſumptuouſneſſe nothing diuerted their minds from a generous and actiue life, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtigated them; which now we moſt commonly finde contrary. For greatneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doe not alwayes agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Architecture of many ancient Temples, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is ſo ſingular and rare, that they that euer ſince haue beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the beſt, durſt neuer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, or vndertake, to equalize them in that kinde of ſingularitie, eſpecially of the Statues, which are ſo done, that neuer any could come neere the originall for exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in taking the Copie: ſo that a man cannot but gather, that in this
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:6321:187"/> place, and thoſe times, there were conioyned all ſingularities toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beſt workmen, beſt wits, beſt Souldiers, and ſo in euery kinde Superlatiue.</p>
            <p>But it may be there are ſome, who will drawe ill concluſions from theſe Antiquities, either tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> or <hi>Superſtition.</hi> For <hi>Atheiſme</hi> thus. If men deſire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize their memories in this kind after their death, it may ſeeme the onely happineſſe (being dead) they can expect, is by this meanes to continue their fame for thoſe acts which liuing they performed, and haue thought of no other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie then this ſort of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their memory: and this may ſeeme to be the end of ſuch as in theſe moderne times make Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or haue left order for ſome
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:6321:187"/> to be erected after their death in their memory.</p>
            <p>To this I will not deny, but that theſe peraduenture might bee the fartheſt ends the <hi>Romanes</hi> aymed at. But amongſt vs the erection of them is free from the corruption. For firſt, where the end is out of a religious care to conſtitute ſome place for our bodies to remaine in, till the day of the general account, I cannot ſee what more blame can bee aſcribed to any, for adorning theſe, then their habitations whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they liue. And beſides, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that theſe bee vſually ſet in publique places, which is an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, they are therefore the more allowable. Again, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the benefit and vſe to ſuch as liue, they be not vnneceſſarie; for if they be of ſuch, whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:6321:188"/> haue deſerued perpetuity in our memory, they breed a kinde of emulation to imitate; if otherwiſe, their liues haue deſerued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt, it is an expreſſion of Gods iuſtice, who hath ſuffered ſuch men, who haue liued ſcandalouſly all their liues, ſo farre to bee blinded, that they perpetuate their ſhame to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, and by ſuch mens Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thoſe who haue heard of their vices, ſeeke to auoid them.</p>
            <p>Againe, there be others, who to ſet a gloſſe vpon their <hi>Atheiſticall</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, argue thus. If the Romans of that time, who were euer repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men of moſt acute iudgement, and reuerenced for their grauity, &amp; vnderſtanding, thought their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt happineſſe after death to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in thoſe outward reſpects, why ſhould it bee thought in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:6321:188"/> age of the world, where men for learning, and height of wit, come ſhort of thoſe which preceded, that we ſhould find new wayes of immortalitie, which the elder world neuer dreamt of, and charge thoſe who haue euer beene ſo much eſteemed for their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with ſo groſſe an ignorance? To this it may be anſwered: Firſt, that theſe <hi>Romanes</hi> had ſome ſence of the immortality of the ſoule, but in what maner, &amp; way, being only guided by naturall reaſon &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were vtterly ignorant. <hi>For there is none but the foole that hath ſaid in his heart, that there is no God.</hi> Again, it is not all the learning or wit of man, can find out the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of true religion, without Gods bleſſing, &amp; holy Spirit to aſſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But to ſuch as theſe, who are onely
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:6321:189"/> learned in naturall ſciences, and had no inſpiration from aboue: how can they but (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith) count <hi>the manifeſtation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion fooliſhneſſe?</hi> So that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt bee no derogation to the truth of Religion, for that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men heretofore vnderſtood it not.</p>
            <p>For the other errour that may be drawne from theſe <hi>Antiquities,</hi> enclining to <hi>Superſtition,</hi> which may be defined to be <hi>a Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in falſe worſhip.</hi> In thoſe times, theſe durable Monuments tended that way: for either men were ſo ambitious to expect <hi>Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> or people ſo fooliſh to giue it them, aſcribing miraculous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration to their dead Images. Which errour needs no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: for all men ſee the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:6321:189"/> of them that deſired, and ſimplicity of ſuch as gaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe to theſe vaine imaginations. And yet I cannot but admire at the ſtrange blindneſſe of ſuch, who in this cleere Sun-ſhine of Chriſtianity, haue ſuch a miſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes (imaginary not reall) that they will ſtill turne the image of the <hi>incorruptible God,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the likeneſſe of a corruptible man, which in any naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſeemes fooliſh, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, profane. I dare walke no farther in this Labyrinth, for feare of growing too infinite, only this, it is the wonder of the world, that men ſhould bee ſo farre carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with this Ideotiſme, which is both againſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now in the next place after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, the religious Antiquities of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:6321:190"/> this place deſerues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, in which, I profeſſe a greater breuity, then in that which is paſt. Of the ſeuen Churches, to which men goe vpon extraordinary deuotion, the firſt is <hi>Saint Peters,</hi> now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying, of a great length, with an anſwerable breadth. You aſcend vnto it by many ſtayres, where, at the firſt view, is preſented the moſt goodly <hi>Facciata,</hi> or forefront of the world, ſupported with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great pillars of Marble. This Church is very high, and vpon the toppe of the <hi>Coppola,</hi> or circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is a <hi>Ball</hi> of braſſe, which to them below ſeems no bigger then an ordinary Bowle, yet is of that capacity, that it will receiue at leaſt forty perſons. The inſide of this <hi>Rotonda</hi> within the Church, is moſt curiouſly painted with the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:6321:190"/> acts of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The finiſhing of the high <hi>Altar</hi> is vndertaken by the <hi>King of Spaine.</hi> The lower part of this round is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with <hi>Moſaique</hi> worke, and the <hi>Altar</hi> compaſſed about with thoſe pillars of <hi>Marble</hi> which are ſaid to haue been in <hi>Salomons Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> they being curiouſly carued &amp; faſhioned in the forme of <hi>wreaths.</hi> On the left hand in a <hi>Chappel</hi> where the Chanons ſing their Office, is the Statue of our <hi>Lady,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in her armes, cut in Marble by the moſt famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Statuiſt in the world, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Angelo.</hi> Within a vault of this Church be the bodies of <hi>Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Saint Paul.</hi> Heere alſo bee ſeuen <hi>Chappels</hi> reſembling the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>Churches</hi> which be vſually vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited. Adioyning to this Church is
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:6321:191"/> the <hi>Popes Palace</hi> of Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> and from thence a <hi>Curridore,</hi> or priuate way, to his Caſtle of Saint <hi>Angelo.</hi> In this Palace the <hi>Conſiſtories</hi> vſually aſſemble, and here is the <hi>Conclaue</hi> where the <hi>Popes</hi> be elected. There is alſo a priuate Chappell of the <hi>Popes,</hi> where the high <hi>Altar</hi> is ſet out by <hi>Michael Angeloes</hi> curious deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day of Iudgement. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in this Palace is the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or famous Library of the <hi>Popes,</hi> which conſiſts onely of <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts,</hi> but of great antiquitie, as well prophane, as diuine. Beſides, all correſpondencies, &amp; matters of State, that are and haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Pope</hi> and other <hi>Princes</hi> be here regiſtred. This Palace hath been ſundry times enlarged by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>Popes.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="367" facs="tcp:6321:191"/>
            <p> The ſecond of the ſeuen <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> is <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> ſeated vpon one of the ſeuen <hi>Hils,</hi> called <hi>Mons Eſquilinus;</hi> vpon which goes this Story, that in the time of the Primitiue Church, there was a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion appeared to a man and his Wife, that very night the ſame alſo appearing to the then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that preſently in that place where that good man and his Wife lay, there ſhould bee a Church built and dedicated to our <hi>Lady:</hi> and this they ſay is that Church which was erected for that dreame. This Church is famous for theſe reliques. The bodies of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> which lye here buried, The Cope of Saint <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Becket,</hi> which he wore at his death, and ſprinkled with part
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:6321:192"/> of the bloud which hee then loſt. And the picture of our <hi>Lady</hi> drawne, as they ſay, by Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> But that which makes this Church now ſo remarkeable, is the two <hi>ſplendid Chappels,</hi> the one built by <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> where he lyes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and the other ouer-againſt it (but more beautifull) by this <hi>Pope Paolo V.</hi> where he is to be buried. In that of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> there be carued all his Acts, during his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> but eſpecially the expedition of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and in the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his owne actions, and Statue, the whole Chappell is moſt richly and curiouſly painted, the high <hi>Altar</hi> ſtanding vpon <hi>pillars of braſſe,</hi> inlayd with <hi>Agate,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in many places adorned with ſtones of ineſtimable price. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late particularly, the magnificence
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:6321:192"/> of both theſe, would aske a longer Narration then I purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The third of theſe <hi>Churches</hi> is Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> without the towne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a myle and a halfe in <hi>Via O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia:</hi> here is vnderneath, the <hi>grottes</hi> or <hi>Caues,</hi> wherein, as in others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Rome,</hi> the Chriſtians in time of perſecution were wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale themſelues, and make their priuate conuentions.</p>
            <p>The fourth in this way alſo, and without the towne, is conſecrate to the memory of <hi>Saints Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Fabian.</hi> In one of the Altars here made of Marble, and about a foote thicke, you ſhall ſee a little hole, in compaſſe about the bigneſſe of a twenty ſhillings piece. Of which there goes this Tale, that a Prieſt in the celebration of Maſſe, and at the time of the conſecration, had
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:6321:193"/> an imagination of the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how vpon the ſaying of the words vſed in the conſecration, the hoaſt ſhould be conuerted really into the body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the hoaſt ſuddenly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly vaniſhed out of his hand, and made this way ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, proportionable to that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>The fift without <hi>Porta Eſquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> is that of <hi>Saint Lawrence,</hi> where his body is interred. This Church was built by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and thoſe inſtruments wherewith they were wont to ſacrifice Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, be here to be ſeene, and more particularly, the <hi>Gridiron</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is ſaid <hi>Saint Lawrence</hi> was broyled.</p>
            <p>The ſixt is <hi>Santa Croce,</hi> one of the principalleſt Churches of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:6321:193"/> built by <hi>Helena,</hi> mother to <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> The ground vpon which this Church is built, is of the holy earth brought by her from <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Amongſt other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, there is a part of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> from whence it tooke the name, and one of the <hi>thornes</hi> of that <hi>Crowne,</hi> which was in deriſion ſet vpon our <hi>Sauiours</hi> head.</p>
            <p>Now the laſt of theſe is that of <hi>Saint Iohn de Lateran,</hi> where the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell was held. The heads of <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> and <hi>Saint Paul</hi> bee heere retained for Reliques. The pillars that ſupport the Altar in this Church, are ſaid to bee brought from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> Heere is the <hi>Font</hi> where <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was baptized by <hi>Pope Silueſter.</hi> Beſides, the pillars are thought to haue beene taken
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:6321:194"/> out of <hi>Pilates</hi> houſe, and that vpon one of them ſtood that <hi>Cocke,</hi> which by his twice crowing gaue <hi>Peter</hi> warning of his ſinne. Heere in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> (where women cannot enter) is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the <hi>Arke of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Aarons Rod, The Sudatorium,</hi> which is a <hi>Napkin,</hi> with which in the way to the Croſſe Chriſt wiping his face, there remained in it his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, The <hi>Table</hi> vpon which <hi>Chriſt</hi> celebrated his laſt <hi>Supper,</hi> and one little <hi>Glaſſe</hi> of his <hi>Bloud.</hi> At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of this Church bee thoſe <hi>Stayres,</hi> brought from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by which <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcended when hee entred <hi>Pylates</hi> houſe, ſome twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in number, wherevpon dayly many people goe vp, vpon their knees for deuotion, vpon euery one ſaying a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and an <hi>Aue</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:6321:194"/> 
               <hi>Maria,</hi> and then kiſſing it. Some alſo whip themſelues as they goe vp. And this Church was alſo built by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Pope Sylueſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To goe more particularly in the narration of the holy Reliques, and Monuments of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the ſeuen <hi>Churches,</hi> they are ſo infinite, that I ſhould be too prolixe. This may ſerue as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view to the reſt, onely I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one ſtrange tale in the Church of <hi>San Pietro ad vincula: Saint Peter</hi> comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> was caſt in Priſon, and bound with a chaine, which after his death was kept as an holy Relique: ſometime after this, the chaine wherewith he was bound in his impriſonment at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> being by Chriſtians brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and into the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:6321:195"/> place where this other was kept, they, as it may ſeeme, for ioy, being a good diſtance aſunder, leaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and ioyned themſelues, and ſtill remaine ſo: ſo was this Church builded in remembrance of that miracle, and herewith I will end this part of my Diſcourſe. Now for my other obſeruations, that I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from theſe holy Antiquities:</p>
            <p>Firſt, I muſt profeſſe for my ſelfe, that I am not ſo credulous, as to tye my beliefe to theſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reports; nay, I am ſo far from it, that I eſteeme moſt of them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fayned then true; yet ſuch is the Artifice of theſe popiſh traders, that they are faine to ſell their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities by this falſe light, and to ſet a gloſſe vpon their Religion, by theſe and ſuch like Illuſions.</p>
            <p>So that heere in the next place
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:6321:195"/> wee are to conſider, how eaſily men are drawne by circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to thinke they embrace certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by ſhadowes to conclude truth, and by outward ſhew of zeale and Religion, to imbrace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. Such is the flexibility of our nature. And by way of digreſſion there can bee nothing more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable, then the variation of minds, as well as faces. Some haue ſuch ſtony hearts and leaden heads, that they cannot conceiue (beyond themſelues, and nature, as they terme it) any ſupernaturall, or powerfull gouernment in their life and actions, nor any heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their ſenſuality. Others ſo beleeuing, and vncertaine, that euery tale, or imagination cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates in their braines a new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and forces a falſe worſhip.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:6321:196"/> Such are theſe which I now ſpeake of. A falſe miracle preuailes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the written verity, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall, and ſeuere-ſeeming habit more perſwades, then ſincerity in life and manners; the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an image ſtrikes deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their affections, then that way whereby God hath made himſelfe manifeſt in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> So that they are carried away with euery winde: ſo great is their corruption, ſo ſtupid their ſences, ſo monſtrous their ignorance.</p>
            <p>By this you may ſee, it is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to perſwade theſe mens conſciences to ones owne fancy, and to ſerue ones owne turne. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe, an outward ſhew of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a few good words car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them into admiration, and to imagine that <hi>God</hi> is better pleaſed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:6321:196"/> with ceremony, then truth, with forme then ſubſtance. This trade hath beene ſo long, and this deceit ſo cuſtomary, that many, though otherwiſe of ſtrong capacities, are blinded with the ſame ignorance as it were by preſcription: but if they would but giue themſelues leaue to review the grounds, vpon which they retaine theſe opinions, and ſearch to the originall from whence they ſprung, they would quickly diſcouer the deceit. But if men will beleeue impoſſibilities, and for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other men doe ſo, and their Fathers did ſo before them; I can thinke no otherwiſe of ſuch, then as of blind men, who are to follow their leaders, and may be ſomtimes drawn into the ditch. A man might ſpin out a long Diſcourſe of ſuch a
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:6321:197" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſubiect: but thus much ſhall ſerue for this obſeruation vpon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious antiquities, and Reliques of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now in order, but very briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as before, Antiquities profane, and then Religious were conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſo now the preſent buildings, and pleaſures, and next the more moderne houſes of Religion be to be diſcourſed of.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I will onely for a taſte, name ſome few places, by which you may gheſſe the reſt. There be in this towne multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Palaces, which for Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and curioſitie, may compare with any Citie of the world, of which, I will but nominate two. The firſt is a houſe newly built by this Pope, at the foote of <hi>Monte Quirinale,</hi> or <hi>Caualli,</hi> giuen to his
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:6321:197"/> brothers ſonne the Prince of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> (a Principality in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples)</hi> built round, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon Pillars of Marble, diuided into three heights, ſeparated by Tarraſſes, and euery one ſtanding alike vpon Pillars. The Court, Tarraſſes, and particular Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers adorned with antique Statues, many of the roomes being moſt curiouſly painted both vpon the top, and ſides, and equall roomes in all three heights, both for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and vſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is a Palace beyond <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> built by <hi>Cardinall Borgheſe,</hi> this Popes Siſters ſonne, a houſe full of pleaſure, and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, where about the middle, from roome to roome, the doores being open, you may ſee in a direct line, the whole length of the houſe, as
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:6321:198"/> it were a proſpectiue, a kinde of curioſitie very much followed in the beſt buildings of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for houſes of pleaſure, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, water-workes and the like; there is that Garden-houſe (as I may terme it) of <hi>Burgheſes,</hi> neere <hi>Monte Quirinale,</hi> built in that place where <hi>Propertius</hi> the <hi>Poet</hi> liued. This is very pleaſant, not many roomes, but three or foure Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, enriched with diuers Statues, and Fountaines. Then there is that of the <hi>Beluedere</hi> by Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> which is the <hi>Popes,</hi> and another garden rare for Fruits adioyning to it. That Garden of <hi>Cardinall Bandinoes,</hi> by the <hi>Nouiceſhip</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> towards <hi>Santa Maria Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glore,</hi> hath Statues &amp; Fountaines in it, &amp; is all vaulted, the better to take the freſh ayre in the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:6321:198"/> Then the Garden ioyning to the <hi>Popes</hi> Palace at <hi>Monte Cauallo,</hi> is very ſplendid: but amongſt thoſe, and all the other Gardens of <hi>Rome,</hi> which be moſt remarkable, thoſe of <hi>Montalto, Maffei,</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franke,</hi> be the three rareſt for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, beauty, ſtore of banquetting houſes, Fountaines, and other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies, that can adde ornament to ſuch places: and thus much of this diuiſion.</p>
            <p>From hence I obſerue, that as mans life ought to bee ſuſtained with thoſe neceſſities which moſt vphold it; ſo there may be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of lawfull delights, and pleaſures, to comfort and refreſh it. For there is no man, or minde, ſo retyred, but requires ſome delight, and pleaſure: otherwiſe the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our apprehenſion would
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:6321:199"/> be tyred, and the progreſſe of our life, ſolitarie; it being an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and Solaeciſme in nature, for a man continually to trauell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermixture of recreation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee be ſo ſubiect, as well in body, as in minde, to variation.</p>
            <p>And in this kinde I know few recreatiues that poſſeſſe vs more, then the humour of building, in reſpect they both ſatisfie our owne preſent inuention, and ſerue to our poſteritie, as perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and memorials of their progenitors, adding preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to our ſelues, perpetuating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the world, remaining as liuing Monuments of our mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and beneficent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>And although munificency in this kinde, be by many eſteemed
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:6321:199"/> ſuperfluous, I rather hold it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, ſo it bee of our aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and diminiſh nothing of the competencie of our eſtates. If it ſhould doe ſo, it were too great an argument of our folly, to propoſe vnneceſſary charges. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe theſe reſpects might make it allowable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, this Art of Architecture is honourable in all mens eſteeme, and profitable to our ſelues. Next, it keepes vs buſied in thought, and action, and ſo diuerts vs from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights more dangerous. Then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion it enables vs in the vſe of fortification. Fourthly, it giues a kinde of extraordinarie delight to our ſelues, when wee ſee thoſe things, which before we had but formed in conceit, made viſible. Next, it is an addition
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:6321:200"/> of repute to the Citie where we liue. And laſtly, it makes a mans fame to ſpread both at home, and abroad.</p>
            <p>But to deſcend more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the pleaſures of this place, the delicacie of Gardens bee of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable conſideration, where a mans mind may receiue ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and his eye ſuch diuerſitie of obiects, as in nothing more. If a place of delight and pleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our minds, it may here be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the beauty of walkes, ſweetneſſe and diuerſitie of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, melody of Birds, and the like. If ſometimes a man be enclined to melancholy, the priuacy and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this place, the murmuring of the waters, fils vs with a ſtrange kinde of ſatisfaction. If one would contemplate the wonders of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:6321:200"/> here hee may finde all things neceſſarie, and pleaſurable; health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or hurtfull for man. If wee be enclined to any ſerious ſtudy, or meditation, here is the place where our thoughts cannot be perturbed, nor diuerted, nor our ſences vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſharpened, becauſe they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meet with ſuch variation. If you meditate, ſit by the fountaine, or walke in the moſt remote and obſcure places. When you would read, or write, then is there Arbors and Banquetting-houſes to repoſe in. And to conclude, if at any time a man would deſire to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; ſome few of his friends, the height of ciuill entertainment, no place can be more apt then this, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the heat of Summer, in a Country ſo ſubiect to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of it as <hi>Rome</hi> is.</p>
            <pb n="386" facs="tcp:6321:201"/>
            <p> If a man were Poeticall, then this diſcourſe, he could not finde a better field to exerciſe his wit. The Houſes of theſe places be adorned with many rarities, but eſpecially painting, the praiſe and excellency whereof is ſufficiently knowne; ſo that I will forbeare the repetition: and thus I conclude this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> In the next place, the preſent Colledges, Churches, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſes come in turne, in which of late yeares, thoſe of the Ieſuits be of principall reputation, where in their chiefe Church lyes buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their founder <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and his Tombe is there to be ſeene. There be beſides diuers Churches appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to ſeuerall nations, as that of <hi>Saint Apolinarius,</hi> to the <hi>Germans, Saint Iames,</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards, Saint</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There is their <hi>Colledge,</hi> and in the Church be the Tombes of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Allen,</hi> and <hi>Parſons;</hi> vpon the walles wherof be ſet forth in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Martyrdomes (as they call it) of ſuch as ſuffered perſecution, and death, for their Religion in <hi>England.</hi> And in this, now amongſt the reſt are <hi>Campian,</hi> and <hi>Garnet,</hi> and the <hi>Hangman,</hi> and <hi>Tyborne,</hi> as perfectly deſcribed, as if they were better acquainted with the place, and perſon. Here is alſo a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary conſiſting moſt of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies. To the maintenance of this Church, and Colledge, there bee
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:6321:202"/> ſome lands appointed, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther penſions that they receiue from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>King of Spaine.</hi> The perſons here bee all Engliſh, and were gouerned by a Rector of the Ieſuites order, called Father <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,</hi> lately dead. They are al Prieſts, and yong Youths, ſent thither out of <hi>England,</hi> to bee brought vp in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber about 120. all going in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Schollers, and no ſooner come thither, but they take vpon them falſe and ſuppoſititious names, as the <hi>Rector</hi> himſelfe told mee.</p>
            <p>This towne is full of <hi>Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>Religious houſes,</hi> many <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Schooles,</hi> where <hi>Diuinitie</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> are read in <hi>Lectures,</hi> and many publique <hi>Libraries.</hi> Beſides, there be ſundry <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:6321:202"/> 
               <hi>maymed, poore, ſicke, and madde folkes.</hi> The number of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be about 140. And ſo I will leaue this part.</p>
            <p>Now for my obſeruation, it is this, to ſhew the Policy that they vſe for confirmation, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and conſiſts, firſt, in an outward ſhew of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with ſtrange expreſſions of humility, ſet forth in the poore and auſtere life of many orders, in their ſundry acts of penitence, in their dayly viſitation of their Churches, in their outward actions of griefe, and repentance at the celebration of <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Wherein is inſerted all poſſible inuentions, to catch mens affections, and to rauiſh their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: as firſt, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of their <hi>Altars,</hi> infinit numbers of <hi>images, prieſtly orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:6321:203"/> and the diuers actions they vſe in that ſeruice; beſides the moſt excellent and exquiſite <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike</hi> of the world, that ſurprizes our eares. So that whatſoeuer can be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, to expreſſe either <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> or <hi>Deuotion,</hi> is by them vſed.</p>
            <p>Their next way, is in their acts of <hi>Charitie,</hi> wherein they exceed, and imagine this a great argument to make the world beleeue the truth, &amp; certainty of their <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, their boaſting of <hi>miracles,</hi> with which they make ſuch a noiſe, and would haue them infallible arguments, to vphold their <hi>faith:</hi> but when a man ſees the ridiculouſneſſe, and finds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the falſitie of them, they are of great force to perſwade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For example, if a man going down a payre of ſtayres, by chance
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:6321:203"/> his foot ſhould ſlip, he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make a miracle of it, and ſay, that in that inſtant he called vpon <hi>Saint Francis,</hi> or <hi>San Carlo,</hi> or ſome other Saint, by whoſe prayers hee was relieued, that otherwiſe he had maymed himſelfe, or loſt his life. Or if in riding in a Coach, it by chance be ouerthrown, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributes to ſome <hi>Saint</hi> whom he then inuoked, the liberation of him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an imminent danger: and with the expreſſions of theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, all the <hi>Churches</hi> be hung full. But for others that be more ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, it is certaine, &amp; hath been proued, that many of them are falſe, and broached onely to delude the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which may giue a great ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the reſt. But more, it is the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> doctrine, and they labour to proue it lawfull, to forge a miracle
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:6321:204"/> for the furtherance of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By which Poſition, if any thing happen, which may ſeeme a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as in the recouery of ſome deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſicknes, wound, or the like, in the attribution of it to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Saint,</hi> or extraordinary ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by their meanes, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the power and glory of <hi>God.</hi> And if any ſigne ſhould happen to confirme it, of which they will nominate thouſands, as the bleeding of a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an <hi>Image,</hi> &amp;c. It may as well ſhew the now deluſiue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Diuell,</hi> ſtill blinding the eyes of the world in this kinde, as hee hath formerly done by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the laſt policy is, in the courſe of their teaching, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plining, which I will onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:6321:204"/> by the practice of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> there. Firſt, there ſhall no ſcandall paſſe, that they will not be ſure to lay vpon our <hi>Religion.</hi> And this at the firſt they beate and inſinuate into the eares of their Nouices. Next, they vſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Art to magnifie their owne: in the meane time, barring the reading of any defence of our parts, and put them to ſtudie ſuch bookes as bee written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs; ſo that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Iudgement, before both parts bee heard. But when they haue them more ſtrongly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and they bee ſure that their opinion is preiudicated, they will ſuffer them then to reade ſome of our bookes (but by the way, this libertie is ſeldome giuen to <hi>Italians)</hi> and then for our ſelues,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:6321:205"/> that be ſo ſtrongly inſtructed of one ſide, and ſtrangely opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated of the other, hee is a rare man, and receiues from <hi>God</hi> a great bleſſing, that euer findes the true difference. And thus being wouen in their nets, they be in a manner deſtitute of all poſſibility of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. And ſo much for this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Now next in order it followes, that ſomthing be ſaid of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtrength of this place, and of what force it is againſt forraigne, or domeſtique enemies. And in my opinion it is of no great power. For examples haue ſhewed, that it hath ſuffered diuers ſurprizes; ſo that of neceſſity it muſt be of leſſe ability now to withſtand then before. For place of ſtrength, it hath onely the Caſtle of <hi>Saint Angelo,</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very weake, to withſtand any
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:6321:205"/> ſtrong aſſault. But the truth is, there be ſo many Princes in league with this Sea, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yed in ſo diuers obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations vnto it, that it is free from danger, without the <hi>Turke</hi> ſhould make a warre; and then there is ſo ſtrong oppoſition like to be made by the Princes of Italy, and other forraigners, that it will be hard to preuaile againſt it, if the <hi>Emperour, Italy</hi> it ſelfe, the <hi>King of France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhould not caſt off their yoke and ſubiection: if ſo, then it were impoſſible for the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> by his owne ſtrength, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Now for the gouernment of this place, it is wholly ſubiect to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which hee holds as a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prince, but ſolely guided by ſpirituall Miniſters; all cauſes of iudgement in matters diuine are
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:6321:206"/> brought hither, as to the laſt Court of <hi>Appeale</hi> for finall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Popes</hi> Reuenue: that which hee receiues from his own principalities, is the leaſt part; the reſt conſiſts in the Fayre of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, liberation from Purgatory, conferring of Church-liuings, ſale of Offices, Penſions from other Princes, and the like. The treaſure is neuer great, in reſpect of the changes of their Gouernours, who for the moſt part haue employed all the Reuenue of the Church to their owne priuate families, and friends. If vpon occaſion they bee forced to make any great, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſupply, they make bold with the treaſures and ornaments of Churches, which be in <hi>Italy</hi> of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great value.</p>
            <pb n="397" facs="tcp:6321:206"/>
            <p> Now to the perſon of this <hi>Pope:</hi> he is deſcended of no great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an <hi>Italian</hi> borne, and exerciſed the former part of his life, before his <hi>Papacie,</hi> in the office of a Iudge. He was made <hi>Cardinall</hi> by <hi>Clement the eighth,</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi> by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the two great factions, in that conclaue of <hi>Montalto,</hi> and <hi>Aldobrandino;</hi> both ſtriuing to make one of their owne creatures, yet finding the other oppoſition too ſtrong, were in the end forced to make a neutrall. And ſo by this fortune it lighted vpon this man. His <hi>Court</hi> is not great (ſome ſmall guard of <hi>Swizers</hi> excepted) but hee rather liues a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired life; the chiefeſt of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tending to the aduancement of his Kindred. He is moſt gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Nephew the <hi>Cardinall</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:6321:207"/> 
               <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> but for matter of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in correſpondency with the greateſt <hi>Princes,</hi> he is behind none, hauing <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> from, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, more then any other temporall <hi>Prince</hi> whatſoeuer. And when he ſhewes himſelfe, it is in as great maieſty, and with more cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony then is vſed to any other <hi>Prince,</hi> which for exemplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall bee ſhewed in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome that is vſed of kiſſing his feet, and the manner of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in a chayre when he goes publiquely.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, vpon his Pantofle there is a croſſe, which people in ſhew of their reuerence and deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, kiſſe at the time of his giuing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Embaſſadors, or ſome other publike aſſembly: and this is to ſhew the peoples reuerence to
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:6321:207"/> his perſon, and to ſet forth his owne dignity. And the ſigne of the Croſſe vpon it, is to declare that in that action, the peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> as well as honour to him, might be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in a kinde, for acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, that Religion is vnder his gouernment, and ſubiection. For his being carried in a chayre vpon mens ſhoulders, they vrge this to be vſed as an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his ſanctity, and holineſſe, to ſtirre vp reuerence in the beholders, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion in their hearts, and that as all outward reſpects be vſed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the <hi>Princes</hi> of the world, ſo there ought to bee much more to the <hi>Pope,</hi> beeing head of the <hi>Church.</hi> In this kinde he is vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried, when he goes to <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Conſiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="400" facs="tcp:6321:208"/>
            <p> Now to end this part with the <hi>Cardinals:</hi> it is ſtrange to ſee their pride, euery one eſteeming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of equall ranke with any <hi>Prince,</hi> and are ſerued with a kinde of extraordinary pompe, vſing in their roomes of audience, cloathes of eſtate, as <hi>Princes</hi> doe, and when they goe to Conſiſtory, you ſhall haue one of them atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by their friends and followers with 20. or 30. Coaches, and at leaſt 200. or 300. <hi>Staffieri</hi> or footmen. Some in this kinde exceed other, but the principall bee <hi>Montalto,</hi> that was <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> that was <hi>Clement the eighth,</hi> and <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> that is this <hi>Popes</hi> fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Some others liue more retired, of which ranke <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted. Moſt of them bee in faction <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and all receiuing
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:6321:208"/> bribes and penſions from him. Their creation comes either from the <hi>Popes</hi> particular fauour, or ſome great <hi>Princes</hi> interceſſion; younger brothers of great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and all in a manner by the way of the preſent fauourite, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches himſelfe, and makes his fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion great, by the diſtribution of theſe honours. I onely ſaw them once aſſembled together, and that was in the <hi>Popes</hi> priuate <hi>Chappell,</hi> at <hi>Saint Peters,</hi> vpon <hi>All-Saints</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when the <hi>Pope</hi> ſang <hi>Veſpers</hi> or Euen-ſong: there were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them about ſome 30. I thinke, all that were then in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where I obſerued 3. things; firſt, their <hi>places,</hi> all ſitting round about the <hi>Chappell;</hi> ſecondly, their <hi>habits,</hi> of Scarlet; thirdly, their <hi>reuerence</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> in the time that the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:6321:209"/> 
               <hi>Antheme</hi> was ſung, euery one in his ranke, one after another, riſing out of their ſeates, and going to his chayre, which is by the <hi>Altar,</hi> where they adore him in this kind, by bending their bodies, kneeling, and kiſſing his garments.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe Cardinals I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally obſerued two: one for his learning, and that was <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a little leane old man; the other was <hi>Cardinall Toſco,</hi> &amp; he, at the <hi>Conclaue</hi> when this <hi>Pope</hi> was choſen, was ſo neere being choſen, that many yet thinke the election went on his ſide. For of 60. hee had 45. voices. But when he was ſet in his Chayre, and they comming to adore him, <hi>Baronius</hi> came in, &amp; ſaid, Will you chooſe him head of the Church, that cannot ſpeake a ſentence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that ſcurrilous by-word of the

               <hi>Lombards (Cazzo)</hi> what a ſhame will this bee in our election? and vpon this diuers of his voyces fell from him, &amp; he loſt the <hi>Popedome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for that I gather from this place, which ſhall be very ſhort, it is this; That the ſumptuouſneſſe of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the pride of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, is one token of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their doctrine; ſeeing they which pretend to haue rule ouer, and to giue direction vnto others, are tainted with this leproſie. For it is neuer ſeene that the body is ſound, when the head is corrupt, &amp; it is impoſſible for any to guide another, that ſtumbles in his owne way, or to bee a directer to others, that ſtands in his owne light.</p>
            <p>More particularly for theſe <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:</hi> it is quite contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:6321:210"/> of <hi>God,</hi> and different from the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> to challenge temporall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or ſuperiority, when their charge is onely to <hi>inſtruct.</hi> And they who ſhould be examples for others to imitate, in life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and in that kind to teach as well by example as precept, what inſtruction can wee gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, but ambitious thoughts, and vnſatisfied deſires after the wealth and glory of this world?</p>
            <p>Againe, their exceſſe in this kind is vnneceſſary; for what can bee pretended for theſe <hi>Popes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiaſticall perſons, that they ſhould ſo violently deſire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſuperfluity in wealth? Are they not, by their owne rules, in a manner, ſeparated from the world, and bard from any
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:6321:210"/> hope of ſucceeders in their owne poſterity? Therefore one ſhould imagine theſe ſo immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, impertinent. And it could be no diminution either to the glory or progreſſe of <hi>Religion;</hi> for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry function it ſelfe is honourable, and reuerenced; and moderate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions both of dignity and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ought to be aſcribed them. But why all ſhould bee included within this center, and wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the perſon of the <hi>Pope,</hi> I neither ſee for it <hi>Reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But laſtly, this extremity of their pride is adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tageous againſt them, and giues dangerous examples e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen amongſt themſelues. When the People be taught moderation and ſobriety, and ſee exceſſe and liberty in their teachers, none is
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:6321:211"/> ſo blinde but muſt ſee their deceit. When they are inſtructed in acts of charity, and perſwaded to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poueriſh themſelues to enrich a <hi>Priest,</hi> who can ſhadow their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage? When they pronounce In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and we pay for them; what man can think the <hi>Pope</hi> hath ſo much intereſt in <hi>God,</hi> as to make him pardon vs, for his profit? When they profeſſe ſanctity and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life; who will beleeue him, when, after he hath gotten to be a <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Cardinal,</hi> he is found to be as proud, ſeditious and couetous as the reſt? When the <hi>Pope</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth pouerty, and as they ſay in his proceſſion, when he is elected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried publikely to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the world, hurles braſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, and vſes theſe words of <hi>Saint Peter, Gold and ſiluer</hi>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:6321:211"/> 
               <hi>haue I none, but that which I haue, I giue vnto thee,</hi> what man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues not their abuſing of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and mocking of the people? When the <hi>Pope,</hi> to ſhew his humility vpon the <hi>Maundy Thurſday,</hi> waſhes the feet of the poore, and in the meane time is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Cardinals, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, ſome giuing him water, ſome the towell, others holding his traine, himſelfe carried into, and out of the roome, as if he were too good to tread on the earth; what man can bee ſo ſtupid that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes not his pride? Thus you may ſee what contrarietie there is betwixt their profeſſion and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And ſo I will leaue this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And now to draw to a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: after this deſcription I doe not
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:6321:212"/> thinke it vnneceſſary to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſafety and danger for an <hi>Engliſh man</hi> to trauell thither. And I am the rather induced vnto it, becauſe I haue heard from many that haue beene there, ſuch ſtrange tales, and ſuch wonders of their eſcape, as if they meant to ſcarre vs with <hi>Rome,</hi> as children be heere with <hi>Hobgoblins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that for ſome perſons there can be no place in the world ſo dangerous for them to come in, as this; and they are ſuch, as haue beene noted either to be extreme perſecuters of them, violently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted againſt them, or ſuch as haue oppoſed them by publike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or writing, in matter of <hi>Controuerſie;</hi> for theſe, it is certaine, if they be found, they ſhall be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought into the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> or
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:6321:212"/> forced to bee reconciled to their <hi>Church.</hi> And yet I do not thinke it impoſſible for any of this ſort to make a Voyage thither, and neuer be ſurprized; but then they muſt neither publiſh their purpoſe nor time; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, haue eyes and eares in all places, and ſuch a man is no ſooner gone, or purpoſes to go out of <hi>England,</hi> but they heare of it, and he can liue in no place of <hi>Italy,</hi> but they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of him. Therefore the ſafeſt courſe for ſuch a one, is to paſſe that, before hee ſettle in any other place, and in the meane time neither to make himſelfe, nor intention knowne to any body li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, for then there may bee a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of diſcouery. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is neceſſary, that he haue ſome other Language beſides his
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:6321:213"/> owne, that hee may paſſe for that Country-man: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome of them hee ſhould troope himſelfe, and bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alſo, that with them hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhew any diſ-affection to the <hi>Religion;</hi> for then they may grow iealous, and diſcouer him. Beſides, I would not haue him ſtay there too long, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with any of his owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>There bee ſome others alſo that may not come hither ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and they are of this ſort, who though themſelues haue in no action giuen them cauſe of offence, yet ſome of their name or Kindred, either were, or bee profeſſed enemies againſt them. Others alſo are endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered heere, if they haue any
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:6321:213"/> particular enemy, that is great in, or hath intereſt with any of the <hi>Colledge</hi> (for no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is put into the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> vnleſſe hee giue ſome publique offence but by their meanes) then perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he may be brought into trouble, onely vpon reuenge and malice.</p>
            <p>But for others, and ſpecially men of <hi>Quality,</hi> their comming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may bee with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as to any other part of <hi>Italy.</hi> I my ſelfe haue, and haue met with diuers that do finde it ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beleeue it, whatſoeuer other men ſay to the contrary, to grace, or make wonderfull their owne <hi>Trauels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after the <hi>perſon,</hi> thoſe <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which may bring a man into danger, ought to bee auoided. If a
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:6321:214"/> man, in his going thither, or being there, conuerſe with <hi>Italians,</hi> and diſcloſe, or diſpute his <hi>Religion,</hi> he is ſure, vnleſſe hee fly, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained on, and brought within the Inquiſition. For they hold it an act of merit, to diſcouer an <hi>Heretique</hi> (as they terme vs) thinking that by this meanes wee may be drawne from our <hi>Religion,</hi> and the honour of our conuerſion (as they call it) muſt be attributed to them.</p>
            <p>Next, when you are in the <hi>Church,</hi> or neere any <hi>Relique, Croſſe,</hi> or <hi>Proceſsion</hi> in the ſtreet; you muſt giue no ſcandal, nor ſeeme to to be ſingular from the actions of other men: but if you be deſirous to auoid their <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> you muſt forbeare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into their <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> at <hi>Maſſe-time,</hi> or <hi>Veſpers,</hi> and bevvare of their <hi>ſtreet-encounters.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="413" facs="tcp:6321:214"/>
            <p> Thirdly, in the place where you lye, you muſt bee carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their <hi>Faſts,</hi> &amp; not be curious in deſiring, or ſeeming to deſire ſuch fare as thoſe dayes will not admit.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it ought to be one of our principall cares, leſt in any place where we ſhould reſide, before our comming thither, wee ſhew our ſelues too bitter and violent againſt our Nation there, eſpecially in their perſons; for that may exaſperate, if it come to their knowledge.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it is a meere folly in any man that hath liued publiquely in any town of <hi>Italy,</hi> before he come thither, to hide and conceale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there, for hee cannot liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcouered: and peraduenture this iealouſie of ours, and diſtruſt of them, may produce ſome miſchiefe
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:6321:215"/> againſt vs, which otherwiſe they would neuer dreame of. But ſome will bee ſo quicke, that they will come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and away before they haue halfe ſlept. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch diſpoſitions, I thinke, they had euen as good liued in <hi>England,</hi> with their Nurſes, and would haue there got as much experience, I am ſure, as much wit.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, I hold it very dangerous, for a man that is knowne to bee there, to goe about to coſen the <hi>Colledge,</hi> and make them beleeue he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> when there is no ſuch matter. For this diſſimulation may cauſe them to force him to expreſſe that which he affirmes, by ſome act, that may foyle his <hi>Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And therefore, methinkes, it is a ſtrange Arrogance in thoſe people, to goe about to deceiue them, that know
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:6321:215"/> their <hi>Religion,</hi> and Character, as well as themſelues.</p>
            <p>Next, in your conuerſation, ſhew (and ſo peraduenture you may haue cauſe) to expreſſe a thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for thoſe courteſies you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: and though they giue you cauſe to ſpeake ſomething in the defence of your <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhew no violence, nor reply not too much, by which you ſhall argue your owne temper, and giue them leſſe cauſe to vrge you. For heate in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, eſpecially where a man comes with diſaduantage, ſhewes folly in vs, and ſtirres malice in them.</p>
            <p>Now the finall caueat is, that by no meanes you goe about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any from thence, though formerly your friend, and neere acquaintance. For you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:6321:216"/> that they who dare let him conuerſe with you, be ſure that he will diſcouer whatſoeuer you ſay, and there is not any one thing, will ſooner breed a miſchiefe againſt vs, then the attempting to diuert one from their ſocietie.</p>
            <p>The laſt point that a man is to enter into conſideration vpon, when hee trauailes to <hi>Rome,</hi> is the time. Firſt, thoſe times of <hi>publique hoſtility,</hi> as in the Raigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when the <hi>Pope</hi> thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red excommunications, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelfe an open enemy to the State, as he did then, it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Next, if the Gouernour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, were of ſo violent and malicious a diſpoſition as <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> was, there were little ſafety. Thirdly, in the time of the <hi>holy weeke,</hi> becauſe then there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:6321:216"/> view, and euery houſholder is to render an account of thoſe ſtrangers he entertaines, that they haue confeſſed, communicated, and the like. Fourthly, if a man ſhould enter into any quarrell, and be apprehended by the Temporall Magiſtrate, the <hi>Inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> alſo takes hold of him, and he cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered till he be reconciled to the <hi>Church.</hi> And laſtly, if a man ſhould fall ſick, during the time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, within three dayes the Phyſician is to take his oath, that his patient hath confeſſed, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, otherwiſe hee muſt leaue him, and the party be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee depart. And thus haue I briefely, and ſincerely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered my knowledge of this place.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>LATTERIE may be deſcribed to be a kinde of ſeducing, or deceiuing by a counterfet, or fained commendation, whereby men are drawne to haue an ouer-good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and liking of themſelues; through this falſe glaſſe, making an vndue and too great eſtimate of their owne parts, and actions;
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:6321:219"/> which, though peraduenture en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the ſubtiltie of <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> yet is nouriſhed, and enlarged by their owne ſelfe-loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flatterers</hi> doe not onely dazle, and deform our Intellectuall parts, but are meere moths in our eſtates, and liue vpon our ſpoile, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their words; and acts, to our wils and inclinations; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inſinuating themſelues into our fauour, they draw from vs our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſo reduce vs to be either the ſcorne of other men, or Tributaries to them; one of which, <hi>Malice,</hi> or <hi>Gaine,</hi> muſt needs be their ayme; the firſt the more dangerous; but the ſecond more common.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines Flatterers to be thoſe, <hi>Qui co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt aliquem, vt auferant ab eo aliquid</hi>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:6321:219"/> 
               <hi>boni temporarij.</hi> For when they commend any, for that he deſerues not at all, or more then he deſerues to be praiſed, for any priuate end, or gaine to themſelues, I can call this exceſſiue pleaſing others in words and deeds, nothing elſe but <hi>Flatterie.</hi> By that inſinuation, they winde themſelues into the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of thoſe, whoſe fortunes and diſpoſitions appeare to be ſuch, that with probabilitie they may hope to worke and prey vpon, by this ſweet infuſion of <hi>Flattery;</hi> all men being naturally inclined to thinke the beſt of themſelues, &amp; to heare of it too.</p>
            <p>Now the humoriſt, that muſt pleaſe, and tickle our fancies, is a ſmooth and ſly enemie, a Wolfe in ſheepes cloathing, and ſo much the more dangerous, and neceſſarie to
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:6321:220" rendition="simple:additions"/> be obſerued, and auoided, fiſhing with a ſubtill, and vnſeene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bayt, <hi>Mel venenatum,</hi> or <hi>venenum melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> ſweet poiſon, or poiſon ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; as colouring treaſon, with the ſhew of friendſhip; diſguiſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, with the pretence of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and freedome in ſpeech, and the like. And this ſeldome but in preſence, and commonly to ſuch, out of whom they hope to ſucke ſome commoditie. Wherefore I may ſay, <hi>Quod diuitum ſunt aſſeclae,</hi> a man of meanes ſeldome wants ſuch followers, ſuch ſhameleſſe and fawning creatures, that force can hardly repell them. And I think this to be the reaſon why <hi>Diogenes</hi> gaue the Epithete to <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> of <hi>Canis Regius,</hi> the <hi>Kings Dogge,</hi> in reſpect of their courſe of life, more ſit to bee compared with the faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:6321:220"/> nature of Dogges, then wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be honoured with the title of men.</p>
            <p>I take <hi>Flatterie</hi> to be that which the Prophet allegorizeth in the Pſalmes, vnder the terme of <hi>Oleum Peccatoris. Emendabit me iuſtus, &amp; arguet me: Oleum autem peccatoris non impinguet caput meum,</hi> diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing betweene the reproofe of a <hi>Friend,</hi> and commendation of a <hi>Flatterer,</hi> chooſing rather the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt correction of a good man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſmooth and pleaſing praiſe of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> who tell vs we are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in the middeſt of misfortune, and make vs thinke our ſelues to be well, when we are moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately infected. Thoſe therefore that be made proud, and inſult, and ſwell, by the praiſes of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers, and Sycophants, of ſuch
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:6321:221"/> a one it may be well ſaid, <hi>Creuit caput, Impinguatum eſt oleo peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> a fat and ſwimming head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when it flowes, and is full of this kinde of oyle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flatterie,</hi> and <hi>Diſsimulation</hi> be of neere kinred; for all the Art of a <hi>Flatterer,</hi> is to ſeeme that he is not: marke but the difference betwixt his outward apparance, and inward deſires; his words, &amp; his thoughts; his ſpeech, &amp; his meaning. Before your friends, or your ſelfe, they giue a <hi>Plaudite</hi> to al your actions, with a ſhew of much loue, &amp; reſpect: but in priuate with your enemies, or ſuch as they may hope to make ſo, by doing you iniuries, they depraue &amp; detract you with a great deale of libertie, and ſcorne: in the meane time, peraduenture taking occaſion vnder the colour of abuſing you,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:6321:221"/> and leſſening your merit, to fall comparatiuely into their praiſes, and ſo at one time, and with one tale, play both the parts of a <hi>Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> and <hi>Flatterer.</hi> Such men as theſe, it were not hard to ſhew you euery day, whoſe continuall trade is to abuſe the company they were laſt in, and to praiſe thoſe they are now withall: ſuch as appeare with the face of frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip, but haue their hearts fraught with more malice &amp; venom the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtings of Scorpions: ſuch as would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue (and ſo euery man, whom by their cloſe and cunning <hi>Flatterie</hi> they ſurpriſe, doth) that they be the only men that giue good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt aduice, and diſcreet cautions, charitable in peace-making, and all other good offices of that kinde: whereas indeed they be the cloſeſt
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:6321:222"/> breeders of miſchiefe, malice, and detraction that do vnworthily liue.</p>
            <p>Theſe mens minds be truely <hi>Hermaphroditized;</hi> theſe be <hi>Plinies Androgyni</hi> in minde, though not in nature, whoſe ſexe reſemble both Male and Female: for you ſhall haue them vary and change as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as thought. And as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with whom they haue to doe, or as their fortunes alter, ſo doe they. Sometimes alſo they be ſo groſſe in their <hi>Flattery,</hi> that they become ridiculous. As for inſtance; the <hi>Flattery</hi> of <hi>Cariſophus</hi> to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany laughing and merry, he ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for company, though he knew not the cauſe. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſeeing him ſmile, asked him why he did ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaid he) I thinke that which moues you to laugh, is worth
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:6321:222"/> laughing at. And this kinde of imitation is commonly the note of a <hi>Flatterer;</hi> but ſometimes alſo the badge of a <hi>Foole.</hi> And ſo <hi>Clyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> the <hi>Paraſite</hi> in <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi> Court, when his maſter hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted becauſe he had the Gout, hee counterfeited lameneſſe too; and whatſoeuer his Maſter was forced to by neceſſity, hee would alwayes affectately imitate, according to <hi>Ouids</hi> deſcription of a <hi>Flatterer,</hi> what you denie hee forſweares; what you affirme hee iuſtifies; if you weepe he is ſad; if you laugh he is merry.</p>
            <p>So that a <hi>Flatterer</hi> is a Monſter vgly to behold, if viſible; dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to truſt, if diſcouered; hath the heads of <hi>Hydra</hi> for any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuous inuention, the hands of <hi>Briareus</hi> for any baſe or diſhoneſt

The words of a Flatterer bee iniquity and deceit,</hi> ouer-growne with canker and ruſt, incroaching vpon vs: at the firſt, intruders of ſmall appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and by that meanes taking the ſurer hold. Theſe bee they that with their <hi>Syrenicall</hi> charmes throw vs vpon the vnauoidable dangers of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis.</hi> Theſe be thoſe Infernal Spirits, that diſſwade from all good purpoſed or intended, and from any thing that hath affinity either with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, or goodneſſe. But on the contrary, prouokers of all vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, corruption, wickedneſſe and obſcaenitie, and as <hi>Theodoret</hi> notes, <hi>Incipiunt a Placebo, ſed in fine ſepeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt in peccatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some there be of this damned crue, who, ſo they may pleaſe you
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:6321:224"/> with praiſes, care neither why nor wherefore they doe it: againſt which kinde of men, <hi>Salomons</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 6. to vs, is worthy the obſeruing. <hi>The wounds of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are faithfull; but the kiſſes of an Enemy be to bee ſhunned.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, his malediction to them ſhould ſerue as a bridle, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Hee that praiſeth his friend with a loud voyce, riſing early in the morning, it ſhall be counted vnto him as a curſe.</hi> And for the moſt part theſe traders practiſe this Art, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hope of fauour or gaine; and that is the reaſon why they preſſe into the company of ſuch as be men of dignitie and place. For as no vermine will breed, where they finde no heate; no Vulture haunt where they finde no prey; no Flies ſwarme where there is no
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:6321:225"/> fleſh: ſo no Flatterer lurkes where he findes no gaine.</p>
            <p>A man may oftentimes finde out a Flatterer by this, that their praiſes, if you well obſerue them, doe oftentimes fall vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties. So, it is plaine, that they ſpeake <hi>ficte, non vere,</hi> fainedly, not from the heart; and that manifeſteth their diſſimulation and deceit; and their praiſing of ſuch actions as we know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be naught, argues their ayme to be directly for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ends, neither for the benefite of him they praiſe, nor good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others. Wherefore I could wiſh, that all men were of <hi>Achilles</hi> his minde, who, as <hi>Homer</hi> reports, <hi>Hated not the gates of Hell ſo much, as hee did thoſe that ſpake otherwiſe then they thought.</hi> And wee had
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:6321:225"/> need bee very well fortified and conſtant in this reſolution: for they bee of ſo ſeruile a condition, that though you reiect them, they will ſtill obſerue; though you ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them your companie, yet they will attempt entertainment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>But they wait onely vpon our good fortunes, and the leaſt winde of aduerſitie diſperſeth them; when our meanes fall, they faile; which plainely ſheweth them to be of a moſt baſe condition. Of this ranke were 2. <hi>Kings ch.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>Iezabels Eunuches,</hi> who in her proſperitie ſerued and followed her with all diligence and obſeruance: but when fortune turned the wheele, King <hi>Iehu</hi> had no ſooner ſaid the word, <hi>Caſt her downe,</hi> but they did caſt her downe. They are moſt
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:6321:226"/> diligent obſeruers of the time, then to vent their <hi>Flattery,</hi> when men bee moſt likely to giue eare vnto them: therefore wee ought at all times to bee very watchfull ouer them; for if once they caſt anchor in our affections, they will hardly looſe their hold.</p>

               <hi>Dolus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Saint Auguſtine, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat cor, adulatio duplicat lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam. Deceit doubles the heart, Flattery the tongue:</hi> theſe two bee mixed together; for when the tongue ſaith one thing, and the heart thinketh another; when the thoughts go South, and the tongue North, there is the diſeaſe. So that <hi>Flattery</hi> cannot ſubſiſt without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation.

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:6321:228"/> examples: Was not <hi>Iudas</hi> his <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> the apparant and viſible means of effecting his treaſon againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when his embracements and kiſſes pointed him out to bee apprehended?

            <p>But although the infection of this peſtilence bee dangerous to all men, yet in reſpect of the conſequence, farre more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:6321:228"/> to men of great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place.

            <p>The credit theſe <hi>Flatterers</hi> gaine to themſelues, is commonly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title and pretence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in ſtead of withdrawing vs from ill, confirme vs in it: like thoſe of whom <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. that ſow <hi>pillowes vnder our armeholes,</hi> ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our vices, that we may ſinne with more ſecuritie, and delight, nouriſhing and increaſing our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as oyle addes flame to fire: wherefore it is very dangerous to giue credit to ſuch, who in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of friends, proue ſo dangerous enemies, confirming and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all our corrupt affections, by conſent, either in conformitie, or application of themſelues to the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:6321:230"/> ſame actions, by approbation, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, though not imitation of their precedent, or by extenuation, or rather iuſtification: as terming anger, ſeueritie: fury, zeale: raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, boldneſſe: puſillanimitie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie: lauiſh expences, liberality: couetouſneſſe, parſimonie, or the like.

            <p>It is the common practice of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> to counterfet, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not imitate, the paſſions &amp; formes of thoſe they apply themſelues vnto, their ſullenneſſe and mirth, as they haue their different varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:6321:230"/> ſo they ſometimes with the Crocodile of <hi>Nile</hi> will nothing but weepe and lament, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately change that tune, to the mirth and ſongs of <hi>Syrens:</hi> now with ioy, ſometimes with griefe conforming themſelues to that humor, which at that inſtant they doe think to be moſt predominant in vs, making themſelues volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlaues to anothers inclination; in the meane time not caring how vntruely, ſo plauſibly they may ſpeake. So baſe is their minde, ſo mercenary their tongue. But when the tide turnes, there is no danger in their power that they will not caſt vpon vs, in laying vs open to our enemies, diſcloſing thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets they haue formerly by their <hi>Flatterie</hi> ſtolne from vs, and the like: ſuppoſing by this diſhoneſt
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:6321:231"/> meanes to ſtand vpright, though his titular friend be declined; or elſe expecting no more aduantage from him, hope vpon the aſhes of his ruine, to build a new fortune with him that cauſed his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. For as <hi>Acteon</hi> was murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his own dogs: ſo they, who aduance and cheriſh Flatterers, are commonly by them ouerthrowne and vndone: all which, by this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue prouerbe of <hi>Salomons, Prou.</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 25. is confirmed. <hi>A falſe tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering mouth cauſeth ruine.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good to follow his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, <hi>Prou.</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>Though hee ſpeake fauourably, beleeue him not, for there are ſeuen abominations in his heart</hi> And as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes of it, <hi>Bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, in a manner, the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be as great betwixt this and <hi>truth,</hi> as <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi> wee had need to pray with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>That we may not bee drawne away with the wicked and workers of iniquitie, that ſpeake friendly to their neighbours, when malice is in their hearts.</hi> Yet now adaies it hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo much the vpper hand of the world, and is growne ſo common, that he who ſcornes to <hi>Flatter,</hi> wil generally be thought to bee either enuious, or proud: for it hath now, in a manner, quite left the name of a vice, and gotten the reputation of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:6321:232"/> a vertue. It hath ſhaken off the old name of deceit, and is now coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the title of wiſedome: it hath quite loſt his ancient attribute of coſenage, and hath gotten it ſelfe graced by the name of Policy. It is neceſſarie therefore, to reduce it to the former colours, leſt the outſide deceiue.</p>
            <p>Be therefore ſo farre from it, as to eſteeme better of a friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, then of all the praiſes a <hi>Flatterer</hi> can giue you, whoſe end is to confirme and faſten you in your errours, by his fained com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, diſſembled loue, and affection; ſubuerting and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your minde from any tincture of goodneſſe, which iuſtifies that ſpeech of Saint <hi>Augustines,</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>Quod plus perſequitur lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua adulatoris, quam manus perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris.</hi>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:6321:232"/> For if the hand of an enemy hurt not ſo much as the tongue of a Flatterer, much leſſe the rebukes of a friend, which will be able to abide all teſts: agreeing with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>He that rebuketh a man, ſhall finde more fauour at length, then hee that flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with his tongue.</hi> Croſſing that paſſage of the Comicall Poet, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequium amicos, veritas odium parit.

            </p>
            <p>But this you may be ſure of, that though theſe diſguized and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full praiſes of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> preſſe more vpon the confirmation of our ill, then of our good parts; yet our nature is ſo fraile, that we are commonly better pleaſed with the couerers, then the diſcouerers of our ill affections; not ſo much
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:6321:233"/> conſidering with our ſelues what we are indeed, as what wee ſeeme to be to others, carried away with a ſelfe-opinion, requiring, as it were, the Teſtimonial of our good parts, not from our owne conſciences, but the vaine report of others; nay, though our conſciences accuſe vs, that thoſe things we be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, deſerue nothing leſſe; yet the <hi>Flatterer</hi> ſo ſurprizeth vs, that we no ſooner begin to condemne our ſelues, but his diſſembling prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; glorious gloſſes, choake that good meditation. Liking therefore ſo well, to heare well of our ſelues, we ſhould endeuour to deſerue it. Whence proceeded all thoſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and vnnaturall vices of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius Nero?</hi> whoſe beginning of Soueraignty, whileſt he gaue eare to good counſell, is compared to
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:6321:233"/> the times of the beſt Emperors; but when once the reynes of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were let looſe, what abſurd, what cruell, what vnnaturall acts did he ſticke at? and yet the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the time ſo obſerued and praiſed him, that they turned his beliefe into an imagination, that his groſeſt vices were reputed for principall vertues. Witneſſe the thankſgiuing of the Senate to the gods, for the murder of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the vaine <hi>Plaudites</hi> hee expected for his ridiculous Rimes, and fooliſh affectation, or rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation vpon the publike Stage of the part of a Minſtrel, &amp; Player; which ſimplicities of his were by <hi>Flattery</hi> ſo wound in him, that when he was, in a manner, certaine of his deſtiny, yet ſome flaſhes of theſe vanities did ſtill remaine.</p>
            <pb n="450" facs="tcp:6321:234"/>
            <p> Now the reaſon, why men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reaſon be ſo ſtrangely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken and blinded with the praiſes of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> is, though common, yet vncertaine to gheſſe; ſure it muſt be either ſuch a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and diſeaſe in our affections, as cannot abide to be remoued, or elſe a ſtrange and greedy appetite to heare our ſelues commended for whatſoeuer we doe: or otherwiſe, a ſuperabounding opinion, and ſelfe-conceit of our owne abilities and parts, that we can doe nothing ſo ill, we ſhall not thinke commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and worthy of praiſe: and ſo from all, or ſome of theſe, it comes to paſſe, that wee deſpiſe friendly admonitions, and are ſo ſubiect to the ſnares of <hi>Flattery,</hi> by which our vices, if neuer ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, be at the leaſt diſguized with
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:6321:234"/> the reſemblance of ſome vertues that be neere vnto them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we ſtop not the beginnings of this dangerous and vnſeen miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, the poyſon will grow paſt recouery, &amp; wholly bereaue vs of the true knowledge of our ſelues. For it is not the preſent <hi>Flatterie</hi> that doth ſo much hurt, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and remaines of it in our minds; for though the <hi>Flatterer</hi> be gone, yet the infection ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, as for inſtance, thoſe who heare Muſick, though that bee done, yet the harmony, ſweetneſſe, and ſound, doth afterwards poſſeſſe &amp; make impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their minds: ſo theſe kinde of praiſes remaine longer with vs, then the inſtant of hearing them. And as a ſweet and pleaſing ſound is not eaſily expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our fancies; and though wee
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:6321:235"/> chance ſometimes to forget it, yet it oftentimes returneth into our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination again: ſo fareth it with the pleaſing diſcourſes of <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi> Therefore we ſhould be deafe to their voices, &amp; auoid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at firſt.</p>
            <p>Yet this ſeemes moſt ſtrange to me, when I ſee men of apparant wiſedome, and great parts, ſuch as are able to diſcerne and enquire of matters of the deepeſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, to bee notwithſtanding ſurprized by the cunning of theſe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers: but certainly any man that thinks well; and loues to heare well of himſelfe, can hardly auoid this trap: for they that <hi>Flatter,</hi> will ſhadow it vnder the colour of friendſhip; as in affabilitie, aduice, free diſcourſe, ſeeming reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, officiouſneſſe in our buſineſſe, conformitie of manners, and the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:6321:235"/> like. All which, though in a true friend, they bee the very tokens of friendſhip, and loue; yet in a <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer</hi> they haue onely the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of it, that thereby they may more cunningly and craftily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſuch as they haue to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The reaſon now why this kind of <hi>Flatterie</hi> is ſo dimme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernable, is becauſe that in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion of the minde, it is ſo cloſely intermixed with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that it can hardly be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it, though if once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maskt, it hath no manner of affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with it, nor comes neerer it, then as glaſſe which is dull and brittle, reſembles Chriſtall, which is ſolid and tranſparent: ſo this <hi>Flattery</hi> is onely the Ape of Friendſhip. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe kinde of men bee farre more dangerous to truſt, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:6321:236"/> enemies, for from them men expect nothing but the fruits of malice &amp; ill will, whileſt the other ſort, vnder pretence of loue and friendſhip, do ſooner &amp; more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly worke the effect. And the difference of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, I put, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe that aſſault vs prepared, and ſuch as take vs vnprouided, or ſtrike when our backs be turned.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing from meane fortunes expectancies cannot be great, they are not much ſubiect to this kinde of battery; the ſiege is laid to ſuch as be men of great meanes &amp; place in the world, thence they hope for fortune, for credit, for preferment; and commonly men of this high ranke doe ſeldome deſcend to the true knowledge of themſelues, that whatſoeuer they do, it is in ſuch an aſſured &amp; imperious faſhion, that it
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:6321:236"/> muſt paſſe vncontrouled, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they doe but thinke, or wiſh to do, muſt be preſently put in act, and whatſoeuer by them is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhall be ſure to finde whole vollies of praiſes; and that they doe ſo certainly looke for, and thinke they deſerue, that it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for any, with ſuch to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the true parts of friends. And ſo it comes to paſſe, that all about them are profeſſors of this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and to ſay truth, I ſee not how this fault, though vſed, can be very much preſſed againſt ſuch as bee followers of theſe men. For this kind of <hi>Flattery</hi> is not ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as forced: yet ſurely an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt mind would be loth to ſubiect it ſelfe to ſo baſe a trade. And theſe great men that haue ſo inured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to to be pleaſed with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:6321:237"/> of <hi>Flatterers</hi> in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neuer ſo bad, can hardly weane themſelues from that habit, cuſtome hath ſo wrought it into them; and notwithſtanding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vpon better thoughts &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, they oppoſe themſelues againſt it, yet that hath not long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, but for the moſt part it returnes againe with greater force. <hi>Vnde ſaepe excluſa, nouiſsime recipitur.</hi> Wherfore the danger is the greater at the firſt, to giue way to this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which is ſo hardly repelled.</p>
            <p>Now if the danger of this be ſo great, and the auoiding of it ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all ſorts of <hi>men,</hi> then no doubt, but <hi>women,</hi> as the weaker veſſels, had need to be very careful, and circumſpect of giuing enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, or hearkening to any of this condition. For beſides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:6321:237"/> danger, which is common to them with all others, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly it doth often precipitate them into worſe ſtraits. For there is not an eaſier, or more ordinary way to corrupt &amp; ſubdue their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, then by this meanes, with entertaining &amp; feeding them with the commendation of their perſon, beauty, behauiour, comlineſſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or the like; being generally of their own natural inclination, ſo full of vanity, &amp; deſirous of praiſe.</p>
            <p>That which I haue hitherto written of the danger of <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> is, when it is ſeuerally applyed to particulars: there remaines one other ſort which I cannot omit, and that is the popular man, that inſinuates and windes himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the loue of the multitude, by pleaſing and prayſing them in all
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:6321:238"/> their deſires, and by application of himſelfe vnto their humours. The end of which obſeruance muſt needs bee, to ſtrengthen himſelfe in their good opinions; by that meanes hoping, that in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of his againſt the Prince or State, they would ſecond his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. This is the common end of affected Popularity, and that thouſands of examples can iuſtifie. If there bee any other inducement, it muſt bee referred to a vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I will onely inſtance two or three examples of the dangerous effects of this popular <hi>Flatterie.</hi> The change of gouernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romanes</hi> proceeded from the fauour and grace that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had obtained amongſt the ſoldiers; and ſo the way was made plaine and eaſie to him, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:6321:238"/> of that ſtate, and making of himſelfe abſolute <hi>Monarch.</hi> And ſo in all, or moſt of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſucceeding <hi>Emperaurs,</hi> popularity with the multitude was the way by which they entred. In our owne Stories, <hi>H. Bullinbrooke,</hi> whom <hi>Richard the ſecond</hi> did well enough foreſee, was cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning in the Art of winning the hearts of the people, and ſo ſought meanes by his baniſhment to preuent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; yet vpon his returne, hee was ſo ſtrengthened by that meanes, that without all colour of right, he acquired the Kingdome, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to himſelfe by the death of the former King. So now, this point I wil conclude with one Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Bible, and will onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the words of the text. The way which <hi>Abſolon</hi> propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:6321:239"/> in the treaſon againſt his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was to make himſelfe popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar by flattering of the people. Marke but the Story, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6. 2. <hi>And</hi> Abſolon <hi>roſe vp early, and ſtood hard by the entring in of the gate, and euery man that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters, came to the King for iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: him did</hi> Abſolon <hi>call vnto him and ſay, Of what City art thou? And he anſwered, Thy ſeruant is of the tribes of Iſrael.</hi> 3. <hi>Then</hi> Abſolon <hi>ſaid vnto him, See, thy matters are good and righteous, but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee.</hi> 4. Abſolon <hi>ſaid moreouer, O that I were made Iudge in the Land, that euery man which hath any matter or controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie might come to me, that I might doe him Iuſtice.</hi> 5. <hi>And when any man came neere vnto him, and did him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance, hee put forth his hand, and</hi>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:6321:239"/> 
               <hi>tooke him and kiſſed him.</hi> 6. <hi>And in this manner did</hi> Abſolon <hi>to all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that came to the King for iudgement. So</hi> Abſolon <hi>ſtole the hearts of the men of</hi> Iſrael. The ſteps of this popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Flattery</hi> (I thinke) cannot bee more punctually deſcribed then in this narratiue. You finde his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <hi>He roſe vp early;</hi> his purpoſed ſhewing himſelfe to the multitude, <hi>He ſtood hard by, &amp;c.</hi> his affability, <hi>And euery man that had;</hi> his finding fault with the preſent gouernment, <hi>Thy matters are good and righteous, but:</hi> a promiſing of redreſſe, if power were transferred to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Oh that I were.</hi> A ſhew of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reſpect and loue to the people, <hi>And when any man came neere.</hi> And this courſe hee tooke, not with any particular; but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himſelfe to all the people.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:6321:240"/> 
               <hi>And in this manner did Abſolon to all Iſrael.</hi> And ſo it came to paſſe, ſaith the text, that, <hi>hee ſtole the hearts of the men of Iſrael.</hi> Thus hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the deformitie of this vice, &amp; dangerous conſequence of it both applyed to particulars, and to multitudes, I will deſcend from this point, and giue you ſome rules and directions how to auoid ſo great a danger, ſo dangerous an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>
            <p>Knowing the ill effects which proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo dangerous a cauſe, a man would thinke reaſon, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to auoid the occaſions of being ſurpriſed with the falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full baits of <hi>Flatterers;</hi> but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily ſhewes ſo great a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our natures, that wee are apt to fall in loue with our prayſes, though farre from our merit, and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:6321:240"/> giuen but for priuate reſpects. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, in this caſe wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too ſurely fortified, it will bee neceſſary to adde ſome cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſtrengthen our reſolutions in the auoiding of ſo great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. And the firſt muſt be, not onely a profeſſed, but an inward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeneſſe, from giuing encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any to thinke they may any way poſſibly euer hope to catch vs in this ſnare. For if wee bee found to haue an open eare, the diſeaſe is ſo catching that it wil be hardly auoided. There are few reſolutions ſo conſtant, that can auoid the miſchiefe, if they admit the diſcourſe of <hi>Flatterers.</hi> The firſt temptations therefore muſt be ſuppreſſed; which if we doe not in time, will ſo encreaſe, that when we would we cannot. For if we be
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:6321:241"/> content to haue men thinke well of, and praiſe vs for thoſe things which in our owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences we doe not deſerue, wee ſhall in time bee ſo beſotted, as to thinke our ſelues worthy of thoſe prayſes, ſo vniuſtly layd vpon vs by theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, who as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pro. ch.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Goe about</hi> as <hi>ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and diſcouer ſecrets; therefore meddle not with them that flatter with their lips.</hi> And this may be a ſecond reaſon to auoid the inſinuation of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> in reſpect of theſe two abhorred crimes, of <hi>ſtandering,</hi> and <hi>diſcloſing of ſecrets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, as their cunning, ſo our care in auoiding them, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; for they bee come to that height and excellency in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that they will colour their <hi>Flattery</hi> with the ſhew of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
               <pb n="465" facs="tcp:6321:241"/> vſurping the offices, behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nay euen carrying the name &amp; counterfet of amity ſo artificially, in taking vpon them the higheſt part of friendſhip, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is free repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that the ſhadow is hard to be diſtinguiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſubſtance. Their loue will ſeem ſo farre to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, where in truth nothing is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto it, not iniury, not profeſſed enmity, not detraction.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore the only comfort of ſociety, (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is in the aſſurance of true friends) is ſo corrupted by the intruſion of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> who would vſurpe a place in eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo high, deſeruing one ſo low, concealing ſo dangerous a poyſon vnder ſo wholſome an apparance, wee need diſcerning ſpirits to exclude ſuch fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, &amp; not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our vertues by moſt voyces,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:6321:242"/> but by moſt deſert. So preſuming euery man to know his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thoſe things for which he is commended, we muſt not eſteeme our happineſſe to conſiſt in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing praiſes, but in deſeruing them.</p>
            <p>But in theſe caſes of perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples many times mouing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> precepts, it will not be amiſſe to view the care that men in former times haue had to repreſſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe &amp; riſing of <hi>Flatterers. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Caeſar,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexander Seuerꝰ</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to haue been ſo ſtrict againſt <hi>Flatterers,</hi> that if any did but extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily bow himſelfe, or ſhew but the leaſt ſigne of <hi>Flattery</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed &amp; expelled their Courts. The Emperour <hi>Sigiſmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> perceiuing one to flatter him groſsly, in ſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, gaue him a blow. Why ſtrike
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:6321:242"/> you me, ſaid he? Why bite you me? ſaith the Emperor. There is a Story of a Nobleman of <hi>Muſcouia,</hi> who being impriſoned, &amp; deſirous of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, fained to dream, the K. of <hi>Pole</hi> was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priſoner, &amp; brought captiue to the D. of <hi>Moſcouia.</hi> This dream was told the <hi>Duke,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>flatter,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded he ſhould bee kept more cloſe, til he ſaw the euent of his dream. <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports, that <hi>Caligula</hi> recalling one that was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the time of <hi>Tiberiꝰ,</hi> &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grating his liberty, asking him how he ſpent all the time of his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he anſwered, he did nothing but pray that <hi>Tiberiꝰ</hi> might dye, &amp; <hi>Caligula</hi> ſucceed: for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded hee ſhould bee put to death. And after this ſort was the youngman
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:6321:243"/> puniſhed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> who hoping to pleaſe him, brought newes of <hi>Saul</hi> and his childrens death.</p>
            <p>So that the neereſt way to auoid ſo bad companions, is ſo to behaue our ſelues, that it may appeare to the world how little wee deſire, how much we ſcorne, what ſmall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we put in the praiſes of <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers.</hi> This courſe <hi>Canutus,</hi> once a <hi>King</hi> of this <hi>Iland</hi> did take; who as <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> recites, walking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhore neere <hi>Southhampton,</hi> the ſoldiers that were about him, did palpably, in magnifying, <hi>flatter</hi> him, calling him King of Kings, &amp; Commander both of Sea &amp; Land; whereat the King being amazed, he reſolued demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtratiuely to ſhew how groſſe their <hi>Flattery</hi> was, and how little hee was moued with it; for which purpoſe commanding
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:6321:243"/> himſelfe to bee ſtript, ſate downe cloſe by the water, ſeeming to ſpeak to the waues in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner: I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you that you touch not ſo much as my feet; they keeping their ordinary courſe, beat vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhore, and notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his charge, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him too: ſo preſently retyring, he returned to his ſoldiers, &amp; ſaid; You called me King of Kings, and Lord of Sea &amp; Land, yet you ſee I could not command theſe waues from touching me: therefore learne, that theſe titles belong not to mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but onely to him by whom all things are gouerned And this was his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terpoyſon to their <hi>Flattery,</hi> agreeing with the tranſlation of a verſe of <hi>Homers,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Nullu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ego ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> numen, quid me immortalibꝰ aequas?</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſomtimes was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be thought the ſonne &amp;
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:6321:244"/> heyre of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and wanted not thoſe <hi>Flatterers</hi> that would indeed haue made him beleeue to haue been ſo. A hurt brought him back to the knowledge of himſelfe, and fall into this ſpeech, <hi>Omnes iurant me eſſe</hi> Iouis <hi>Filium, ſed hoc vulnus me hominem eſſe clamat. Alſweare that I am the ſon of</hi> Iupiter, <hi>yet this wound proclaimes me to be but a man.</hi> So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience daily ſhewes, that where they can get audience &amp; gain, they neuer care how abſurd their praiſes be, laying moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe vices that deſerue greateſt reprehenſion. If we run into ryot, they commend our temperance; when wee expreſſe our follie, they praiſe our wit: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if we did but wel obſerue, how our vvorſt faults by them are applauded for principall vertues, our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences would
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:6321:244"/> tell vs, they bee but Impoſtors and deceiuers, diſcerning with <hi>Seneca, Vos dicitis me eſſe prudentem, ego autem ſcio quam multa inutilia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcam, nocitura optem. You ſay I am wiſe, and yet I finde, that I haue many vnprofitable deſires and hurt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full wiſhes.</hi> Which if wee bee as willing to practiſe, as capable to know, if our affections abound not aboue our reaſon, diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their <hi>Flatterie</hi> for ſuch things as wee merit not, wee ſhould quickly abandon them our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie.</p>
            <p>And hence it will fall into our conſideration to obſerue the cauſes and reaſons for which wee bee praiſed, whether they bee for ſuch vertues wherein we haue a part or not, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they honour vs for that wee
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:6321:245"/> doe not deſerue, for their owne profit: and this muſt bee done by the true contemplation of our ſelues; not ſuffering our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in our owne perſons, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend too reſolutely vpon the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others; but without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality look your ſelfe in your owne glaſſe, and if you meete with any other that bee falſe, or flatter you, truſt them not, but let your owne conſcience be your owne prayſer, and be not ſo ſimple as to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with things that be not, neither bee too peremptory in your owne iudgement; but take ſo much as your conſcience aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures you may bee iuſtly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and no more; for as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> ſayes, <hi>Si vera ſunt coram mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no teſte laudatus es, ſi falſa ſine teſte deriſus es.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="473" facs="tcp:6321:245"/>
            <p> The way then to prepare &amp; recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our iudgements in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelues, is to loue, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to be pleaſed with the hearing of truth, though it ſearch deep into our own wounds: and if we come once to endure ſo ſharp a corroſiue, it is certaine we ſhall neuer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the praiſes of <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers.</hi> But it will bee neceſſary to foreſee (which I haue enlarged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that a <hi>Flatterer</hi> creepe not in, in the habit of a friend, &amp; ſomtimes take the liberty to finde fault with our errors, by that meanes to giue a better gloſſe to the inſinuation of their <hi>Flatterie:</hi> but theſe, if truely obſerued, will bee found like falſe gold, which onely hath the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of true, and ſuch as if throughly tryed, cannot poſſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the touch, notwithſtanding
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:6321:246"/> the ring of the piece be of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt metall: but if it be not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good, the deceit is greater, then if it were plainely counterfet. Let vs count then of friends, as of the <hi>ſalt</hi> commanded in the ancient <hi>ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> as of the <hi>hony</hi> forbidden in them: for the ſalt of ſound and faithfull reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the true relliſh and beſt part of a friend, whereas ſweet honyed <hi>Flatterie,</hi> though for the preſent pleaſing our fancies, yet is of a moſt loathſome and dangerous conſequence.</p>
            <p>But a mayne impediment that blinds &amp; choakes our vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from receiuing any aduice and premonition that can be giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſubtilties, and inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> is the too great confidence, and too permanent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:6321:246"/> of the proſperitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this tranſitory and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing life. Thoughts ſo low, ſo ſhort, be the grounds vpon which theſe men do lay their foundation. How can any man <hi>Flatter</hi> vs more extremely then we doe our ſelues, relying on, and delighting onely in the pleaſures &amp; vanities of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing world? This Lethargy both Stories &amp; <hi>Scripture</hi> manifeſt, to the ruin of multitudes, who liuing in al maner of ſenſuality, yet diſcerned it not till all hope and remedy were paſt, continuing the courſe of their life in pleaſure and idleneſſe, neuer conſidering, how that in the mean time, their arraignment was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in heauen.</p>
            <p>We need therefore to get the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ouer our ſelues, and the Art of ſubduing our own affections; for
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:6321:247"/> otherwiſe this ſelfe-louing inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wil ſo ſtirre, and moue our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, &amp; deſires, to haue our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning our ſelues, ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the applauſe of others, that it will be impoſſible for vs to reſiſt their ſnares, being ſo deſirous of praiſes, and ſo willing to receiue them; which is the only aduantage a <hi>Flatterer</hi> can get, when a man ſtriues to acquire reputation for thoſe vertues of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he neuer parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated, &amp; is moſt impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the leaſt checke for any vice, though knowing it to bee inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant within him; a kinde of fancy, which is moſt certainely neither guided by iudgement, nor reaſon. And this is it w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> layes vs ſo ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; makes vs ſo ſubiect to the practice of <hi>Flatterers;</hi> which if for any thing before ſaid, we deſire to auoid, that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:6321:247"/> it ſhould neither entrap nor endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vs: let vs looke diligently into our ſelues, &amp; make a true Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our own diſpoſitions, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, but really: and then we ſhall finde ſo infinit a number of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, imperfections, &amp; faults, mixed in our words, deeds, and thoughts, that we cannot chooſe but ſee the falſity and deceit of ſuch as haue praiſed and flattered vs for thoſe vertues, wherein we haue had no manner of ſhare. And ſo leauing this part, I come to ſome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and limitations, leſt in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall inueighing againſt <hi>Flattery,</hi> it may ſometimes be miſapplyed.</p>
            <p>A man is not bound to be ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious a Criticke, as to take vpon him the diſciplining of euery body for their errours &amp; imperfections. The error is in defending or prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:6321:248"/> not in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealing them. A man may be too buſie, and where there is no obligation of duty, or reſpect, too narrow an Inquiſition may be impertinent. If wee ſmother the faults of thoſe that truſt and rely vpon our aduice, that cannot be exempted from the imputation of <hi>Flattery;</hi> but to ſuch as we be meere ſtrangers, &amp; tyed to in no manner of obligation, there as it is moſt baſe to praiſe their defects, ſo it is not neceſſary at all to finde fault with them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ciuility &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, to men though knowne yet aboue, or equall with vs, to whom we haue no bond but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; as we do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend, ſo we are not bound to take notice of what we know of their errours. Far be it from vs to vſe any meanes
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:6321:248"/> to ſettle them: but on the other ſide to take vpon vs the aſſurance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing them, vpon the ſtrength of our oratory, and perſwaſion, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times too high a hope, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth friendſhip. Men loue not to haue their faults ſeen or known, and there is no ground of aduice or direction, when thoſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe withall, do ſeeke to conceale their infirmities from vs.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſeeing praiſing is the <hi>Flatterers</hi> weapon; it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether it bee vnpoſſible to praiſe a man, without <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> him, as hauing a conſequence and dependancie the one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Without queſtion no. For if wee doe truely and moderately commend thoſe things in another which they iuſtly deſerue, that tends to their good, encouraging
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:6321:249"/> them in thoſe vertues for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they be commended, to the end they may encreaſe, and that others may be animated by their example, to the imitation of the like. This kind of praiſing, without any priuat end or reſpect to our ſelues, can in no ſence be termed <hi>Flattery,</hi> but <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> which is the marke of true friendſhip, and not of fained loue.</p>
            <p>There is now one queſtion to be reſolued, whether <hi>Flattery</hi> can bee reckoned in the number of ſinnes, or no. For if it be one, how comes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 10. 32. <hi>Giue no offence, &amp;c.</hi> 33. <hi>Euen as I pleaſe all men in all things.</hi> Seeing that to pleaſe all men in all things, cannot bee without <hi>Flattery;</hi> for ſo our praiſing, and pleaſing, may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Catalogue of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. To this, I reſolue, that
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:6321:249"/> neither to praiſe, nor pleaſe, in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues can be termed <hi>Flatterie,</hi> but may be made ſo by their ends and circumſtances. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in the end of the 33. <hi>ver.</hi> expounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, meaning that he would haue vs pleaſe all men, ſo as we ſeeke not thereby our own glory, and profit, but the good of our neighbour. And ſo neither pleaſing, nor prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing can be called <hi>Flattery,</hi> more then the iuſt reprehenſion of him that is faulty, can be called <hi>detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And now I am arriued at the laſt part of this diſcourſe, wherein I will lay down ſome diſtinct rules, and notes, wherby a <hi>Flatterer</hi> may be diſcouered.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a man you ſhall alwayes ſee a ſtrife &amp; ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſteale into the affection of thoſe they depend vpon, with more then an ordinary
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:6321:250"/> pace, too aſſiduous care, and ſeruile obſeruation, by all meanes, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring not onely to get the ſtart, but to keepe others backe in the good opinion of thoſe they follow, by diligence on their parts, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imputations vpon others, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing their affections; that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly they will ſuffer none elſe to be inward, or about them, but ſuch as fight vnder their banner, and be of their own ſtamp. And then as a ſhadow continually follows a man whereſoeuer he goeth: ſo they will imitate and affect whatſoeuer it be that their patrons apply themſelues vnto; and there is no vice in them, which from theſe, will not haue their colour, approbation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement.</p>
            <p>And the principall part they act, is either to further ill actions, or ſo
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:6321:250"/> to conceale them, as a man ſhal not ſee his own imperfections. <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> they ſeek to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate in our affections: they will ſweare we be the men of only emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and marke; That thoſe to whom we ſhew fauour, &amp; reſpect, are ſufficiently honoured, and ſo praiſe vs to a kinde of dotage, that we thinke all thoſe who doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually obſerue, and commend our ſuppoſed abilities, neglect it out of ignorance, or enuy; whereas the <hi>Flatterer</hi> yeelds to, &amp; approues of all his actions, though ſuch as in his own conſcience and beliefe be manifeſtly worthy of reproofe and ſcorne.</p>
            <p>Then if you mark the perſons to whom their praiſes be applyed, you ſhall ſeldome heare them giue a good word of any man, but before
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:6321:251"/> his face, except it bee to ſuch by whom he thinks his praiſes may be related, and that is his cunning; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſlandering &amp; backbiting is as common a trade of a <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> as commending of one in his preſence. For in detracting from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they either hope to pleaſe thoſe they now apply themſelues vnto, or elſe take occaſion compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely by caſting aſperſions vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, to magnifie the contrary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of thoſe they be withall: but whether deſeruedly, or no, that with them is not materiall.</p>
            <p>Againe, you ſhall find that thoſe actions which they ſeeme ſo much to approue, and commend in vs, their owne iudgement and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will not allow of: for if a ſtranger, or a man, whom they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to obſerue, ſhall by way
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:6321:251"/> of argument, fall into diſcourſe of ſuch &amp; ſuch vicious actions, as they haue formerly allowed, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Patron, their reaſon wil force them to diſauow and diſlike them, except they imagine, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is vpon deſigne to conuince them of <hi>Flattery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And but obſerue whether thoſe praiſes they beſtow vpon you for any action, they onely giue to you, and no other; or to you, and all others; and you ſhall general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde, that their praiſes goe not according to the merit of the action, but affection of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for thoſe things they do now commend you for, they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend in another, and thoſe things they commend in another, they will as quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in you.</p>
            <pb n="486" facs="tcp:6321:252"/>
            <p> Beſides, you may note that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer our actions and affections doe vary and alter, yet their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be conſtant, and their opinions will ſeeme to be the ſame, though in contrarieties, which is a kinde of <hi>Paradox;</hi> for let vs but now ſay or doe one thing, wee ſhall haue their <hi>Plaudites</hi> for it: ſome diſtance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if our opinions, and actions chance to change to the contrary, they alter not their praiſes, they be ſtill the ſame they were before, they lye as the winde goes; if you change into formes neuer ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they doe ſo too. For there is no vniforme equalitie in all their actions, and intentions, becauſe they haue no permanent place, or perſon, to apply them to. Their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions can in no kinde be ſettled, becauſe they haue wholly giuen
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:6321:252"/> ouer themſelues to content and pleaſe others, and the courſe of their life is vncertaine, being neuer like themſelues, but changeable, and varying from one forme to another.</p>
            <p>And if a man would but examine the beauty and deformitie of his actions, by the rule of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he ſhall finde thoſe things, for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> many times hee is ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended, to be naught, and of dangerous example; and ſuch vices, as notwithſtanding their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, his owne conſcience hath often accuſed him of, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times he hath been aſhamed of.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe that be diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers, are to be diſcouered alſo by their inconſtancie: for allow them now the followers of one that is great in fortune, and place, if they
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:6321:253"/> chance to decline; and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the plot and malice of an enemie, or competitor, their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice fals off too, their expectancies being fruſtrated, and are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo baſe, as to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ouerthrower of him they haue haue beene ſo much bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto; &amp; peraduenture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues too haue been inſtruments of his deſtruction. But with their new maſter, whatſoeuer he likes, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes; approues, or diſauowes; loues, or hates, they are of the ſame mind that they ſeemed to be w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp; in a maner do like the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who amongſt many other flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſpeeches, to <hi>Auguſtꝰ,</hi> ſaid that they, who called him <hi>Caeſar,</hi> knew not his <hi>greatneſſe;</hi> and they that called him not <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his <hi>humanitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="489" facs="tcp:6321:253"/>
            <p> Alſo in publike aſſemblies, as <hi>Parlaments</hi> and the like, ſome of this ſort doe often crowd in, the groſneſſe of whoſe obſeruance cannot poſſibly be concealed; for you ſhall neuer heare them, but you may ſee a farre off, their aime is for priuate reſpects, not publike good; either through <hi>Flattery</hi> or <hi>feare</hi> of ſome perſon there preſent, whom they wiſh may alwaies ſpeake before them, that they may bee ſure not to differ from his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and whatſoeuer it be, good or bad, it is by them ſure to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded. And if ſpeaking before, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing hath chanced to ſlip from them that they ſee is diſliked, they then fall to ſhifts and excuſes, to purge themſelues, by interpreting their words; or if that wil not ſerue, acknowledging their ignorance,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:6321:254"/> and altered iudgement vpon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information, and ſo their note is quite changed; but theſe ſorts of <hi>Flattery</hi> being plaine and palpable, eaſie to be found out, and ſo auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are the leſſe dangerous; for plainly to affirme, or denie as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the ſame, the groſsneſſe of that <hi>Flattery</hi> is eaſily diſcerned; whereas they that are more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their trade, are hardly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not vn-vizarded, which is my now endeuour to doe.</p>
            <p>You ſhall finde ſome to <hi>flatter,</hi> when they ſeeme to reproue, and <hi>flatter</hi> moſt, when they ſhew to be moſt oppoſite againſt it. Of this ſort of <hi>Flatterers</hi> was <hi>Agis Argiuus,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Alexander</hi> liberall in gifts and rewards to a certaine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous fellow, murmured that <hi>Alexander</hi> would ſhew ſuch boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:6321:254"/> to ſo vnworthy a fellow. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> hearing him mutter, asked him what he ſaid. Indeed, ſaith he, I muſt confeſſe that I cannot with patience endure to ſee, that all you that are deſcended from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſhould be ſo delighted and pleaſed with <hi>Flatterers.</hi> For as <hi>Iupiter</hi> kept <hi>Vulcan</hi> for his mirth, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> tooke great delight in <hi>Sylenus:</hi> ſo ſuch as theſe, be of account and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation with you. <hi>Tacitus</hi> alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites an example, though ſomwhat more groſſe, that may bee referred to this ſort of <hi>Flatterers.</hi> When the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> was in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> one roſe vp and ſaid, It was fit that euery man ſhould ſpeak freely, and in matters belonging to the Common-wealth, no man ought to hold his peace: <hi>Tiberius</hi> and all the <hi>Senate</hi> were in expectation
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:6321:255"/> what ſo bold a preamble would produce, and then with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, <hi>Parturiunt montes, naſcetur ridiculus mus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> there is a fault wee all blame you for, though none dare take the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to tell you of it, you ſpend your ſelfe too much in caring for vs, wearing your body both day and night in labours for the <hi>Republike,</hi> not valuing your owne ſafety and health, in regard of our happineſſe and proſperity. This kinde of <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> that goes in the habit of frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and libertie of ſpeech, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſcure. And if this, which ought to bee a remedie, proue the way and meanes more colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to <hi>flatter,</hi> without good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obſeruation, we ſhal hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouer their ayme.</p>
            <p>Some againe not vnlike theſe
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:6321:255"/> will, by another way of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, lay the ground for their <hi>Flattery;</hi> as if by chance they ſpye in vs any ſmall and petty er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, they will declaime with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie and earneſtneſſe againſt them; ſo that their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to, or conniuencie at our great and monſtrous deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, by this their ſeeming ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, may in a manner bee ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed. Which kinde of cunning, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> notes, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Hercules</hi> his club in a play, that ſeemes weighty, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed light, and filled with wooll or feathers. So this reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding libertie, which a <hi>Flatterer</hi> vſeth, will vpon examination be found weake, and of ſmall force to giue a blow. For inſtance, if your clothes bee not of the new
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:6321:256"/> faſhion, your beard not of the late edition, your hat not of the laſt block or the like; from hence, for theſe they will take occaſion with a kinde of ſeueritie to cenſure and correct you. But admit you ſhould deſpiſe your parents, abuſe your wife, neglect your children, ſcorne your kindred, conſume your eſtate, or fall into numbers of notorious vices, theſe they will neither moue nor ſtirre, theſe they will neither take knowledge of, nor regard.</p>
            <p>Others ſomtimes you ſhall note, the better to diſguiſe their <hi>Flattery,</hi> will, by reprouing of men for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vices, confirme thoſe they haue. As if a couetous man once in his life ſhew a little liberality, or if you wil, inclining to prodigality, (for the Prouerb ſaith, Whoſe feaſt is ſo great as a mizers?) they will
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:6321:256"/> vpon this ſingle occaſion, ſeem out of their loue to be much grieued at the vaſtneſſe of his expence, and careleſneſſe of his ſtate. And if an enuious ſlanderer, that neuer loued to ſpeake well of any body, by chance bee ſo conuinced by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they mans merit, that hee ſpeake a few words in his commendation, they wil preſently impute this for a fault, and an argument of facilitie, for commending of one rather out of eaſineſſe, then deſert. And after this manner, thoſe vicious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which wee haue inhabitant in vs, they doe ſeeke to confirme, and ſettle for euer remouing, not by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing their vices, or alone repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the contrarie; but ſometimes alſo by diſcommending the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vertues: as calling zeale, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; liberality; prodigalitie;
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:6321:257"/> parſimonie, couetouſneſſe; and ſo forward: vſing the ſame Art to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintaining of any vice that they thinke a man hath a minde to.</p>
            <p>If they happen to meet with one that ſuſpects all praiſes that be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or thruſt vpon him, ſuch a one they will not commend as from themſelues, but inuent ſome good reports they heard of him abroad, and expreſſe how glad they were to heare ſo well; heerein imitating the <hi>Rethoricians,</hi> who often in their Orations vſe the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the firſt. Or, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, accuſe him of ſome ill they haue heard layd to his charge, which hee knowing to bee vntrue, and ſo denying, they will finde matter to fall into a laudatory of his abilities, by ſhewing how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:6321:257"/> he was of thoſe vices that the world had taxed him withall. And if theſe wayes ſerue not to make him thinke too well of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, they will not in words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, but in a ſilent kinde of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing and good opinion of his parts, will expreſſe it by ſeeking his opinion, or relying and truſting to his iudgement and diſcretion in ſome things that may concerne themſelues; which when deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they will ſeeme to admire, and preferre before any opinion or Counſell they haue receiued from any other bodie. But if a man could ſuſpect this before-hand, giue them but ſome abſurd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and ſo you ſhall diſcouer them. For they are prepared to commend it whatſoeuer it be. Seeing then by this before, that the colours of <pb n="498" facs="tcp:6321:258"/> Friendſhip and <hi>Flattery</hi> be ſo like, and hardly diſcerned; I will in the laſt place ſhew ſome maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt them both, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>A friend will neuer be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ill, or diſhoneſt actions: but in ſuch as may turne to the good and profit of him he loues, none is more willing then hee: where, on the contrarie, a <hi>Flatterer</hi> ſeekes to gaine our good opinion, by being employed in actions of the worſt ſort, and moſt dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in reſpect of our good ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fortune, or name; not caring for the euent, ſo they may raiſe themſelues by our ruine, louing our meate and meanes more then they doe our ſelues, continuing friends vnto vs, no longer then our purſe perſwades them therevnto.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:6321:258"/> And whereas a true friend imitates our actions in nothing but that which is good; the <hi>Flatterer,</hi> like a <hi>Camelion,</hi> that turnes himſelfe into all colours but white, can frame himſelfe to any likeneſſe but good; ordering all his actions, not to the good of his friend, but his owne priuate reſpect, and turnes all to his owne particular benefit; whereas Friendſhip ſeekes not ſo much the good of it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>A Friend reproues his friends vices, and commends his vertues rather to another, then himſelfe; whereas on the contrary, a <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> alwayes prayſes him in ſight, as well for his vices as vertues, and behinde his backe, is as liberall in blaming and defamation of him; ſaying, that hee poſſeſſeth him wholly, gouernes him at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:6321:259"/> and makes him doe what hee liſt. So, whereas a true friend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues the good name and fortune of him he loues, the <hi>Flatterer</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates him to all manner of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ruine.</p>
            <p>A Friend is alwaies conſtant and ſettled in his opinions; the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Flatterer</hi> being diuers, like waxe, or a looking-glaſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing different formes, praiſing or diſprayſing, euer applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the minde and inclination of him that hee <hi>flattereth,</hi> vexing himſelfe too violently in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he doth, in the knowledge and view of him that he obſerues; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall in prayſes and offering of ſeruice. <hi>Non imitatur amicitiam, ſed praeterit,</hi> hauing no moderation in his outward actions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily no inward affection, which
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:6321:259"/> is a condition quite different from the nature of a friend.</p>
            <p>A friend will neuer commend and approue any actions of ours that be vicious, but friendly and freely diſſwade vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Flatterer</hi> doth alwayes giue the victory, applauding whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we do, ayming no further then to pleaſe; whereas a true friend doth not reſpect ſo much how hee may pleaſe, as profit.</p>
            <p>A Friend endeuours alwayes to procure in vs a loue of thoſe things that be reaſonable and honeſt: a <hi>Flatterer</hi> rather deſires to confirme vs in libertie and pleaſure. And where all men haue theſe two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires within them, the one giuen to vertue and goodneſſe, the other to licentiouſneſſe and paſſion: the true friend alwaies aſſiſts the better part,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:6321:260"/> in giuing counſell, and comfort; and the <hi>Flatterer</hi> applyes himſelfe to the other, which is voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and full of paſſion; ſo feeding our affections by deuiſing of ſome vicious and diſhoneſt pleaſure, that they quite diuert vs from the rule of reaſon; like ſome kinde of meat, that neither breeds good bloud, nor engenders ſpirits, nor ads vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor or ſtrength, but onely breeds fogs and rotten humours that bee neither faſt, nor ſound: ſo, if a man looke narrowly into a <hi>Flatterer,</hi> all the good he ſhall finde to come from him, is onely the encreaſing and ſettling of our worſt and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt affections, wherevnto we ſeem to haue but the leaſt inclination.</p>
            <p>So that, as it is plaine, a true friend alwayes reſpects the good of another, more (which is the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:6321:260"/> ground of his loue) then any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular purpoſe or deſigne for his owne aduantage; on the contrary, the ends of a <hi>Flatterer</hi> bee Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to the deſires of a Friend, who will no leſſe bee willing to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of his calamity, then proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; whereas the other doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and follow him onely in his proſpering euill. By which you ſee, it cannot poſſibly ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for one man to bee both a Friend, and a <hi>Flatterer,</hi> which is as much as if I ſhould ſay, a Friend, and no Friend: or rather an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie then a Friend.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He nature of all ſorts of <hi>Lawes,</hi> whether they concerne <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo haue reference to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Lawes,</hi> or whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <hi>ſocietie,</hi> and <hi>conuerſation,</hi> and ſo be meerely <hi>Humane,</hi> is properly this, to be the ſtraight and perfect rule, by application wherevnto, <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> are diſcerned, and diſtingniſhed one from another:
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:6321:263"/> and the knowledge, and practice of them, bring a double benefit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Publike,</hi> which is the generall good, &amp; gouernment of the <hi>State;</hi> or <hi>Priuate,</hi> which conſiſts in the quiet, and peaceable life of euery one in particular. So the true end of all <hi>Lawes</hi> is to ordaine, and ſettle an order, &amp; gouernment amongſt vs, the Iuriſdiction whereof we are rather bound to obey, then diſpute; <hi>Lawes</hi> being, as it were, the Princes we ought to ſerue, the Captaines we are to follow, the very rules, by which all the actions of our life be ſquared and diſpoſed. They are the peoples bulwarks, and defences, to keep them in ſafety, and peace, that no <hi>vniuſt thing</hi> bee done againſt them; that by the <hi>Lawes</hi> men may be made <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>happy;</hi> and that the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of offenders ſhould
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:6321:263"/> appeare to proceed from a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie forced, rather then a will volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, and that by the example of puniſhing ſome, others might bee made the better; that by the feare, and terrour of them, mens audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might be repreſſed, and their innocencie, &amp; peace, ſecured from force and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>If men were not limited within certaine rules, ſuch confuſion would follow in gouernment, that the differences of Right &amp; wrong, Iuſt and vnlawfull, could neuer be diſtinguiſhed; and that would cauſe ſuch diſtraction in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; giue ſo great an ouerthrow to conuerſation, and commerce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, that all right would be peruerted by power, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie ſwayed by greatneſſe: ſo that the equall adminiſtration of
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:6321:264"/> 
               <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> is the true knot that binds vs to vnity and peace amongſt our ſelues, and diſperſeth all ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vnlawfull courſes, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe libertie would inſinuate, preſeruing euery man in his right, and preuenting others, who if they thought their actions might paſſe with impunitie, would not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their courſes, by the rule of <hi>Aequum</hi> and <hi>Iuſtum,</hi> but by the ſquare of their owne benefit, and affections: &amp; ſo not being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within reaſonable bounds, their reaſon becomes inuiſible; whereas when they finde that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice hath a Predominant power, they are deterred from proceeding in thoſe acts, that otherwiſe their owne wils, and inclination would giue them leaue to effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> affirmes the neceſſitie of
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:6321:264"/> Lawes to be ſo great and abſolute, that men otherwiſe could not bee diſtinguiſhed from vnreaſonable creatures: for no man naturally is of ſo great capacitie, as completely to know all the neceſſities, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, which bee required for a common good: and then if a man could ſuppoſe in any ſo perfect a knowledge, yet is that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be found, that either abſolutely could, or would doe all that good which he knowes: ſo that in an <hi>Vtopia</hi> of ſuch men as be not, yet the neceſſity of lawes are abſolute. But where mens affections and manners are depraued, and giuen ouer to vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnreaſonable deſires, there <hi>Lawes</hi> be ſo neceſſarie; that <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> ſaid, A Citie needed rather to defend their <hi>Lawes,</hi> then <hi>Forts:</hi> for without <hi>Lawes</hi> no people can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt;
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:6321:265"/> without defences, it is poſſible that they may: agreeing with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> obſeruation, who ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Lawes</hi> to bee as the ſoule of a Commonwealth; for as a bodie without a ſoule, remaines not; ſo a People without due adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lawes,</hi> doe wholly decline: but take people, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly mixt of the good, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort, nay rather, more of the bad, then better compoſition, yet it wil euidently appeare, that Lawes are ſo abſolutely neceſſary, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine from ill, to confirme in good, to make a happy concord, and vnion in our ciuill conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make ſuch a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt lawfull, and exorbitant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as vnlawfull affections may not be coloured with good appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; that it can not be denyed,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:6321:265"/> that <hi>Lawes</hi> bee the onely ſinewes of contracting people together, and not meerely vſefull, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</p>
            <p>But in the exerciſe, and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lawes,</hi> ſuch moderation is euer to be held, that it may appeare rather to to be vſed, as a preuenting Phyſicke, by way of example to warne others, that they fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like danger, then out of a deſire to afflict, or make miſerable any priuate perſon: and therefore the concluſion of <hi>Tacitus</hi> is very obſeruable, <hi>Pauca admodum vi tractata, quo caeteris quies eſſet; In ſome few matters ſeueritie was vſed, by that meanes to cauſe quietneſſe in the reſt.</hi> So that it is neceſſary in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Commonwealth to cut off offenders, as well for preſent ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as preuention of further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:6321:266"/> which wil be plain, if we wil but obſerue the benefits that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and inconueniences that ariſe, if this exemplary Iuſtice bee not executed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when any fact is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully committed, there is no other ſatisfaction left to the world, or the partie offended, then the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the offender; vvhich if it bee not executed, Iniuſtice vvere as vvell offered to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like State; as to the priuate perſon of him who hath ſuffred the iniury.</p>
            <p>Next, as it incourageth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men in their iuſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actions; ſo it abates the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of others, who bee onely bridled with the feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for otherwiſe the vvorſt men by wickedeſt courſes, were moſt likely to make great fortunes,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:6321:266"/> and to carry the greateſt ſway; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> vvould ſo diſcourage men honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed, that they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue will, nor power, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to labour for the publike.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it baniſheth all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption from ſuch as thinke, that their reputation &amp; wealth, Riches, or Offices, can preſſe down Iuſtice, or make it encline to their purpoſes: for if theſe reſpects ſhould preuaile, iudgement were meerely inuerted, and would not looke vpon the cauſe, but the Bribe; the right, but the power; the truth, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the greater Aduerſary.</p>
            <p>Again, it addes confidence to the poorer ſort, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee that equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; not fauour, procures the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and ſo by this means are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if it were not for this, in what a miſerable
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:6321:267"/> caſe were theſe lower degrees of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubiect to be trod vnder feet by their imperious Aduerſary, &amp; then to haue no means left for redreſſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly; it is the greateſt honor, and reputation, a Kingdom, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth can be ambitious of, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, to haue Iuſtice iuſtly diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and people obedient to <hi>Lawes;</hi> Iuſtice guarding the people, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting &amp; cutting off ſuch as giue ill example to the reſt. And in what Commonwealth ſoeuer this is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, it breeds co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, giues aduantage to their enemies, &amp; cauſeth their diſreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpread through the world.</p>
            <p>Next to the honor of a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> it is the ſafety of the <hi>King,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed to be as the fountain of <hi>juſtice,</hi> ſo <hi>Iuſtice</hi> keeps the fountaine free from <hi>corruption, infection,</hi> or
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:6321:267"/> 
               <hi>danger,</hi> preſcribing rules for feare it corrupt, aſcribing Antidotes for feare of infection, &amp; preſeruing his perſon, &amp; reputation both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, &amp; inſenſitiue danger: wheras if <hi>Lawes</hi> bee neglected, his <hi>perſon</hi> is more ſubiect to the attempts of <hi>Traitors,</hi> his life to the tongues of malice and detraction, &amp; his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to perpetuall infamy.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, this is it, that enriches and ſecures the ſubiect in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, giues him his right, protects him from wrong, increaſeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and proclaimes traffique throughout all the world: whereas if Iuſtice were not duely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, there would follow a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of our ſubſtances, a generall diſconſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our life, &amp; a certain ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all trade with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And mark but narrowly, and
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:6321:268" rendition="simple:additions"/> you ſhall ſeldom find that <hi>God</hi> euer bleſſed that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, where Iuſtice was either neglected, or abuſed.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therfore (if any ſuch inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures be) that diſlike there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, &amp; ſtriue, &amp; declaime againſt obedience to <hi>Lawes</hi> (which may be truely termed the wals of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; nations) they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible, as no obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs can be worthy the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering: for a generall diſſolution of Lawes in a ciuill body, is the ſame with the conuulſion of the ſinnewes in a naturall; decayes, and diſſolution, being the immediate, and vnauoidable ſucceeders. And yet a man had better chooſe to liue where no thing, then where all things be lawfull: which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why all men haue thought it more dangerous, to liue in an <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
               <pb n="517" facs="tcp:6321:268" rendition="simple:additions"/> then vnder a <hi>Tyrants</hi> gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the violent deſires of one, muſt neceſſarily bee tyed to particulars, in a multitude they are indefinite.</p>
            <p>The firſt degree of goodnes is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>Lawes,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> be nothing elſe but vertue, and good order of life, reduced vnto certain rules: and as reaſon hath the predominant power in our naturall bodies, ſo the body Politick ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſubſiſt w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> out ſoule to inanimate, to gouerne, to guide it, &amp; that is <hi>Law,</hi> proceeding from the reaſon, counſels, &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of wiſe men. For where <hi>Lawes</hi> be wanting, there neither <hi>Religion,</hi> nor <hi>life,</hi> nor <hi>ſocietie</hi> can be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. There be three branches that mens Lawes do ſpread themſelues into, euery one ſtricter then other. <hi>The Law of Nature,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we enioy in
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:6321:269"/> common with al other liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> which is common to all men in generall: &amp; the <hi>Municipall Law</hi> of euery Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is peculiar and proper to this or that Country, and ours to vs as Engliſhmen.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Nature,</hi> which is the ground or foundation of the reſt, produceth ſuch actions amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs, as are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to euery liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not only incident to men: as for example, the commixture of ſeuerall ſexes, which we call <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> generation, education, &amp; the like; theſe actions belong to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, as well as to vs. The <hi>Lawes of Nations</hi> bee thoſe rules which reaſon hath preſcribed to all men in generall, &amp; ſuch as all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one with another doe allow and obſerue for iuſt. And laſtly, the
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:6321:269"/> 
               <hi>Peculiar Lawes</hi> of euery Country, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> mixe with the generall <hi>Lawes</hi> of all places, ſome particular ones of their own: &amp; this is that which the <hi>Romanes</hi> called amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, the <hi>Ciuill Law</hi> of their <hi>City,</hi> and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in euery <hi>Nation:</hi> the <hi>Municipall Lawes</hi> of that Country, as it were <hi>Lawes</hi> onely created for thoſe Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, for thoſe eſtates.</p>
            <p>Take away the power of <hi>Lawes,</hi> and who is it that can ſay, This is my Houſe, or my Land, or my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or my goods, or call any thing that is his, his owne. Therfore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans ſtate and fortune is more ſtrengthened and confirmed by <hi>Lawes,</hi> then by any will or power in thoſe from whom wee receiue them; for whatſoeuer is left vnto vs by the <hi>Teſtament</hi> of another, it is impoſſible we ſhould euer keepe it
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:6321:270"/> as our own, if <hi>Law</hi> reſtrained not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers claimes, &amp; confirmed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not vnto vs. In which reſpect, <hi>Lawes</hi> be the ſtrongeſt ſinewes of humane ſocietie, helps for ſuch as may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerborne, and bridles to them that would oppreſſe. So that we receiue much more benefit from <hi>Lawes</hi> in this kinde, then from <hi>Nature;</hi> for whereas men be naturally affected and poſſeſſed with a violent heate of deſires, and paſſions, and fancies, <hi>Lawes</hi> reſtrain &amp; draw them from thoſe actions, and thoughts, that would precipitate to all manner of hazzards and ill, which naturall inclination is prone enough vnto; and do gouern, direct, alter, diſpoſe, &amp; as it were bend them to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vertuous &amp; good actions.</p>
            <p>Wherfore <hi>Lawes</hi> be the true <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicions</hi> and preſeruers of our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:6321:270"/> life, &amp; ciuill conuerſation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting thoſe il accidents that may happen, purging and taking away ſuch as haue broken forth, &amp; ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, plenty, wealth, ſtrength, and all manner of proſperity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. And for thoſe things that be ill, but yet introduced by cuſtome, ſeuere and iuſt <hi>Lawes</hi> will readily correct; for the force and power of <hi>Law</hi> doth eaſily diſſolue an ill cuſtome, though it haue been of long continuance: the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and praiſe of which <hi>Lawes</hi> can neuer be better illuſtrated, then in that ſaying of <hi>Salomon: Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum lucerna eſt; lex, lux, &amp; via vitae, increpatio diſciplinae. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is a lampe; and the law is light; and reproofes of inſtruction, are the way of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The diſpenſers and interpreters
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:6321:271"/> of the <hi>Law,</hi> be the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> and all ſorts and degrees of men whatſoeuer, be tyed &amp; bound to the obſeruance of the ſame. To this purpoſe, <hi>Solon</hi> being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, What <hi>City</hi> was beſt gouerned? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That, wherein the City obeyed the Magiſtrate, and the Magiſtrate the Lawes:</hi> and certainly that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is better, which vſeth ſet and firme <hi>Lawes,</hi> though not all of the beſt ſort, then that where the <hi>Lawes</hi> bee moſt perfect and exact, and yet not obſerued. <hi>Lawes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be the rulers of men, and not men the maſters of <hi>Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but that <hi>Lawes</hi> were at the firſt inuented, as well to giue rules to the good, that they might know how to liue peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly &amp; regularly one with another, as to repreſſe the audacity of thoſe
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:6321:271"/> vnbridled ſpirits, who, in deſpight of diſcipline and reaſon, doe thruſt themſelues into all kinds of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and diſorder; from which bad cauſe notwithſtanding, according to the old rule, a good effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: <hi>Ex malis moribus, bonae leges oriuntur.</hi> But the particular intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of <hi>Lawes,</hi> ariſe either from a preſſing neceſsity, or a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing and prouiſionall carefulnes of thoſe that make them; theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from prouidence, the other from ſome ſence of euill. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue cauſes in the making of prouiſionall <hi>Lawes,</hi> are either loue of their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, or deſire of glory, or affectation of popularity, or ſomtimes particular intereſt, and priuat reſpect; for it often happens, that a priuate good may haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the publike. And the
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:6321:272"/> ſence of ill, decaying either by the encreaſe of it, or a ſeeming to bee deſtitute of remedy, is the cauſe, that where <hi>Lawes</hi> are once forced, out of the ſenſe of miſchiefe, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, they be for the moſt part grieuous and immoderate; as on the other ſide, ſuch as reaſon &amp; prouidence do produce, are many times more ſpecious then vſefull. In the firſt, take away the ſpur and ſenſe of ill, and it makes men in the conſtitution of <hi>Lawes,</hi> to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and vnwary; and in the other, if there bee not continued a ſtrong and conſtant affection, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly faint in the execution of them.</p>
            <p>But in the meane time there is no doubt, that there are certaine fountaines of <hi>naturall Iuſtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> out of which hath beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:6321:272"/> &amp; deriued that infinite variety of <hi>Lawes,</hi> which ſeuerall people haue apted to themſelues: and as ſeuerall veines and currents of water, haue ſeuerall qualities and taſts, in reſpect of the nature of that ground and ſoyle, thorow which they flow and run: ſo theſe <hi>Lawes</hi> and the vertue of them, which bee fetched fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an originall fountaine, receiue a new kinde of application, and tincture, in reſpect of the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Country, the <hi>genius</hi> and nature of the people, the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and forme of publike actions, diuers accidents of the time, and ſundry other occurrences, I will not ſtand to repeat. And in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Lawes,</hi> wiſe men haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had theſe things in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Firſt, the <hi>Common-good,</hi> and benefit, for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they intend them,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:6321:273"/> and that requires that they ſhould be both <hi>iuſt</hi> and <hi>profitable:</hi> now no <hi>law</hi> can bee <hi>profitable,</hi> nor yet iuſt; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is made for priuat &amp; particular reſpects, &amp; not for the publik good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>perſons</hi> to whom they be to be applyed; that for the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; application of them, they be ſuch as may be poſſible to be obſerued, &amp; apt for the cuſtoms, places, &amp; time, where, &amp; when they be to be vſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The preſent courſe of the State;</hi> what Lawes there haue beene vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receiued, by what ſpeciall ones it hath beene conſerued, and by what new ones it may be aſſured: for one kinde of <hi>care</hi> is not fit for all places, and Countreys.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lawes,</hi> when they are once made, ought very rarely to be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> purpoſe the ancient po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of wiſe men is not vnworthy
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:6321:273"/> the obſeruing, <hi>that nothing is to bee changed in the Lawes of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which hath a long time by theſe Lawes preſerued it ſelf in good ſtate &amp; gouerment:</hi> &amp; as <hi>Iſiodor'</hi> wel noteth, after a Law is once made, <hi>we ought not to iudge of it, but according to it.</hi> And yet in theſe two caſes the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Lawes</hi> may turne to the better. 1. When by the changing of it the <hi>Law</hi> is made more perfect, more cleere, more poſitiue, more profitable. 2. When the condition of ſubiects &amp; gouernment is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there of neceſſity the <hi>Law</hi> muſt vary, according to the difference &amp; diuerſity of the times and perſons: for change &amp; variatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Lawes,</hi> are either by occaſion of entertaining forraigne cuſtomes, or ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deficiences, or exceſſes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the alteration of time. One
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:6321:274"/> of theſe is ſo far from innouation, that it is altogether neceſſary: but that is not introducing of <hi>Lawes</hi> by way of imitation of other people; it argues a deſire of change, rather then any cauſe that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall. But on the other ſide, old and ancient cuſtomes, in reſpect of their very antiquity, doe induce a kinde of harſhneſſe, and breed ſaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; for the wilfull retaining of a cuſtome againſt the preſent reaſon of the time, is altogether vnequall.</p>
            <p>This is to be vnderſtood of <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Lawes,</hi> made and applyed to new and ſeuerall accidents. For the fundamentall lawes, vpon which the fabricke of a common-wealth and people be grounded and built, they in no caſe will admit innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither are the other ſort to bee lightly altered, but where the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:6321:274"/> preſent cuſtome of the time finde them impertinent, and the State thinks them vnvſeful. To illuſtrate, in the ſame times, ſometimes we ſee <hi>Lawes</hi> mutable, &amp; fit to be ſo: ſuch as are made in time of warre, peace doth extinguiſh, and ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; agreeing with <hi>Liuie</hi> ſpeaking to this purpoſe: <hi>Quae in pace latae ſunt, plerunque bellum abrogat; quae in bello, pax; vt in nauis adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, alia in ſecunda, alia in aduerſa, tempeſtate vſui ſunt.</hi> And although change of <hi>Lawes</hi> be ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it ought notwithſtanding to bee done with a great deale of caution: but yet it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that time, of all things is the greateſt innouator, and therefore wilfully to preſcribe the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an old <hi>Law,</hi> in reſpect of antiquity, the face of the world
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:6321:275"/> and affaires being changed, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an introduceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of nouelty; for the preſſure of the vſe of it, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſetting it only forth with the grace of antiquity, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it bee oppoſite or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the preſent times &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, makes that old <hi>Law,</hi> if practiſed, to fall, and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into a new and vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Now for my iudgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vſe of <hi>Lawes,</hi> I thinke this, that as the vſe of much <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke</hi> and diuers Phyſicions, argue the aboundance of humours, and diſeaſes; ſo the multiplicity &amp; num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Lawes,</hi> be manifeſt ſignes of a diſeaſed &amp; diſtempered <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> And therefore to follow the ſimilitude, as in <hi>diſeaſes</hi> new expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments be dangerous, where thoſe
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:6321:275"/> that be ancient and approued may ſerue; ſo new <hi>Lawes</hi> bee needleſſe, when the maladies of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique may be cured by the old: for it is a thing both vnequall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt to inſnare the people with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are twinnes, the abſence of one, is the deformity of the other; being in a kinde <hi>conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibilia,</hi> and inſeparable. That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon we haue ingrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our natures, is a <hi>Law,</hi> directing what we are to doe, forbidding the contrary, according to <hi>Cicero: Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ratio cum eſt in hominis mente confirmata, &amp; confecta, lex eſt.</hi> For <hi>Law</hi> is nothing but <hi>reaſon</hi> dilated and applyed vpon ſeuerall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and accidents, the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> as of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like enormities, and neceſſities, for
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:6321:276"/> which they be ſeuerally, at ſeuerall times made, being infinite. The diſeaſe commonly in our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hauing the prioritie of the remedy. And thus the reuerence, and duty wee owe to <hi>Lawes,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but obedience to reaſon, which is the begetter, correcter, and preſeruer, of the very <hi>Lawes</hi> themſelues: thoſe therefore who will not obey them, do come more neere the nature of <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages,</hi> then men indued with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: but I goe on.</p>
            <p>If a reaſon be demanded why all Countreys doe differ, and vary ſo much in their cuſtomes, and <hi>Lawes,</hi> I anſwere, that it proceeds from the cuſtome of the firſt inhabitants. As we may ſee where there are ſeueral plantations by one people, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally giue different orders, &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:6321:276"/> according to the intent and purpoſe of the firſt Planters, and according to the neceſſitie, and end of the preſent Plantation, as may bee obſerued in the different Conſtitutions, &amp; <hi>Lawes,</hi> in our two late Plantations, of <hi>Virginia,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Bermuda's.</hi> And though, I confeſſe, that theſe originall cuſtomes, may in time bee altered, vpon ſeuerall occaſions, diuers changes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, or vpon conqueſt, as with vs; yet I doubt not, but that ſome reliques of the old cuſtomes would remain to perpetuitie, if a people be not wholly extirpate. I ſhould now punctually ſearch the ſeuerall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Inuenters of <hi>Lawes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt different Nations, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their diuers oppoſitions, and emulations, one with another,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:6321:277"/> but that would bee too long, and vncertaine: I will therefore onely in a word touch the originall, and growth of <hi>Law</hi> amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> as being more certainely knowne, and of larger extent.</p>
            <p>You muſt vnderſtand that at the firſt they had no other ſet <hi>Law,</hi> then the will, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of their <hi>Princes.</hi> That gouernment being changed, and ſo their conſtitutions extinct, the people were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by precedent, &amp; cuſtome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any direct, &amp; written <hi>Law;</hi> but that continued not many yeeres. Then the <hi>law</hi> of the 12. Tables ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> in reſpect of their own defects, had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Grecians:</hi> &amp; theſe, as in <hi>Lawes</hi> it commonly happens, being ſubiect to diſpute, were forced to be reconciled, and decided, by the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:6321:277"/> authority, and arguments of the moſt great, graue, &amp; learned men, which afterwards being collected, &amp; gathered together, became a kind of volume, &amp; body of <hi>Law,</hi> and ſo afterwards, before the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was ſubuerted, receiued by diuers men, in ſundry ages, ſeuerall additions: but after the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was <hi>Monarchical,</hi> the preſent Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did adde to the old, or confirm or aboliſh them, according to their own will, and power. And all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that which is commonly knowne by the name of the ciuill <hi>Law;</hi> &amp; becauſe it continues to be the moſt practical, &amp; generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <hi>Law</hi> of the world, and that though all Countreys haue Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>Lawes</hi> of their owne, yet this <hi>Law</hi> in euery place carries ſome ſway, and authority, in ſome places
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:6321:278"/> more, and in ſome leſſe, and that an aſperſion is caſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, &amp; foundation of our <hi>Lawes,</hi> in being different &amp; contrary to the original beginning of the ciuill <hi>Law,</hi> I will briefely parralel them together; wherin if any do not find ſo punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall an agreement as hee expects, let him remember that the nature of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, implyes but a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and affinity of one thing to another, and not a totall and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute agreement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Law</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> vſed, and ſo we, is either <hi>written,</hi> or <hi>not written.</hi> Thoſe that were <hi>written,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> were of theſe kinds. 1. <hi>Lex,</hi> and that is ſuch a Law as was made by the people, but firſt propounded by the Senat. Such are thoſe Lawes with vs, as are confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the lower Houſe of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:6321:278"/> &amp; propounded by the higher. 2. <hi>Plebiſcitum,</hi> and ſuch were the <hi>Lawes</hi> made by the whole people (the order of <hi>Patritians</hi> excepted) &amp; offered to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration by the Tribune; like thoſe <hi>Lawes</hi> that be approued by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons in our <hi>Parliament,</hi> and propounded by the <hi>Speaker.</hi> 3. <hi>Senatus conſultu,</hi> &amp; thoſe were ſuch <hi>Lawes</hi> as were ordained by the power and authoritie of the <hi>Senat,</hi> to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we may reſemble the conſultations &amp; directions of the Kings Councell, and the Decrees of the Star-chamber. 4. <hi>Principum Placita,</hi> which were Conſtitutions appointed by the Soueraign power of the Prince; ſome of them being perſonall, &amp; not exemplary; others more publike; of which kinde with vs be al the <hi>Kings Edicts,</hi> &amp; <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> of what kind ſoeuer. 5. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratuum</hi>
               <pb n="538" facs="tcp:6321:279"/> 
               <hi>Edicta,</hi> as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Generals</hi> in the Field, <hi>Gouernors</hi> of Prouinces, and the prime Magiſtrates in great Cities: like as with vs is that power which is deputed to the <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Preſidents</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wales,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenants</hi> of euery <hi>Shire,</hi> and the Iuriſdiction of <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their particular cuſtomes, priuiledges, and immunities, in the great Cities, &amp; Corporations of this Kingdom. And laſtly, <hi>Reſponſa Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which were the Iudgements and opinions of ſuch as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be <hi>Iudges,</hi> and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Law:</hi> and iuſt of that kinde bee the reſolutions of our <hi>Iudges,</hi> which in writing bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto vs, by the name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,</hi> and <hi>Caſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lawes vnwritten</hi> (amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <pb n="539" facs="tcp:6321:279"/> were ſuch as <hi>cuſtome</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, &amp; yet neuer ſuffred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction by a Poſitiue <hi>Law.</hi> Such <hi>Traditions</hi> as they had receiued touching the ancient manner, and forme of gouernment of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, in precedent times; and of this nature with vs is our common Lavv, grounded much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cuſtom.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon why theſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtomes may bee collected to be of ſo great force, is, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before their approbation it is to be conceiued, that they had paſſed al cenſures for neceſſary, and to be without offence: and ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued this facile approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are allowed, and moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly kept; for <hi>Lawes</hi> of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt weight, &amp; conſequence, which occaſioned <hi>Cicero</hi> to write <hi>ante ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am memoriam, &amp; morem ipſum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium,</hi>
               <pb n="540" facs="tcp:6321:280"/>

            <p>But more preciſely to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Custome,</hi> that the tearmes, as well as matter, may be vnderſtood, you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that where any forme, or <hi>Law,</hi> hath had any long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in practice, without any
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:6321:280"/> knowne Author, it then receiues the name of an ancient cuſtome, or <hi>mos Maiorum:</hi> which though in name, and Title it differ from a <hi>Law,</hi> yet in power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it is the ſame: which <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> confirmed when hee ſaid, <hi>Diuturnam conſuetudinem, pro Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ac Lege, in jis quae non ex ſcripto deſcendunt, obſeruari ſolere.</hi> And there is great reaſon for it, becauſe <hi>Lawes</hi> are in eſteeme, and authoritie with vs, for no other reaſon, but in reſpect they haue had the reputation to bee allowed, and made by the Iudgement of the people.
